<h3>Memory consumption</h3>

Memory consumption by the editor and the build process has been improved since previous releases. It is still a work in 
progress. You may encounter either two memory-related errors:
<ul>
  <li>Java Heap Space OutOfMemory: You can increase the maximum heap size by specifying the -Xmx (Sun VM) VM option in the eclipse.ini
  in your Eclipse installation. For more details, see the Eclipse online help.</li>
  <li>Java PermGen OutOfMemory: You can increase the PermGen area's size by specifying the -XX:MaxPermSize (Sun VM) in the
  eclipse.ini file.</li>
</ul> 

Additionally, it may be useful to reduce the number of simultaneously opened editors.

<h3>Build performance</h3>

<p>The current build mechanism is somewhat conservative in determining the set of files to be recompiled upon each save.
This will cause longer build times under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>We've provided a building option, "Conservative Build" - turned on by default, which if turned off (see <a href="../prefs.html#compiler">X10 Preferences</a>) can result in shorter 
build times. However the shorter build time comes at the expense of incorrect behavior for certain X10 source programs.
