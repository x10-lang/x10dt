<div class="p"><!----></div>
Many concurrent algorithms proceed in phases: in phase k, several
activities work independently, but synchronize together before proceeding on
to phase k+1. X10 supports this communication structure (and many
variations on it) with a generalization of barriers 
called <em>clocks</em>. Clocks are designed so that programs which follow a
simple syntactic discipline will not have either deadlocks or race conditions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following minimalist example of clocked code has two worker activities A
and B, and three phases. In the first phase, each worker activity says its
name followed by 1; in the second phase, by a 2, and in the third, by a 3.  
So, if <b>say</b> prints its argument, 
<b>A-1 B-1 A-2 B-2 B-3 A-3</b>
would be a legitimate run of the program, but
<b>A-1 A-2 B-1 B-2 A-3 B-3</b>
(with <b>A-2</b> before <b>B-1</b>) would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The program creates a clock <b>cl</b> to manage the phases.  Each participating
activity does
the work of its first phase, and then executes <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> to
signal that it 
is finished with that work. <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> is blocking, and causes the participant to
wait until all participant have finished with the phase - as measured by the
clock <b>cl</b> to which they are both registered.  
Then they do the second phase, and another <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> to make sure that
neither proceeds to the third phase until both are ready.  This example uses
<b>finish</b> to wait for both particiants to finish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This chapter describes the syntax and semantics of clocks and
statements in the language that have parameters of type <b>Clock</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The key invariants associated with clocks are as follows.  At any
stage of the computation, a clock has zero or more <em>registered</em>
activities. An activity may perform operations only on those clocks it
is registered with (these clocks constitute its <em>clock set</em>). 
An attempt by an activity to operate on a clock it is not registered with
will cause a 
<b>ClockUseException</b>
to be thrown.  
An activity is registered with zero or more clocks when it is created.
During its lifetime the only additional clocks it can possibly be registered with
are exactly those that it creates. In particular it is not possible
for an activity to register itself with a clock it discovers by
reading a data structure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The primary operations that an activity <b>a</b> may perform on a clock <b>c</b>
that it is registered upon are: 

<ul>
<li> It may spawn and simultaneously  <em>register</em> a new activity on
      <b>c</b>, with the statement       <b>async clocked(c)S</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> It may <em>unregister</em> itself from <b>c</b>, with <b>c.drop()</b>.  After
      doing so, it can no longer use most primary operations on <b>c</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> It may <em>resume</em> the clock, with <b>c.resume()</b>, indicating that it
      has finished with the current phase associated with <b>c</b> and is ready
      to move on to the next one.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> It may <em>wait</em> on the clock, with <b>c.advance()</b>.  This first does
      <b>c.resume()</b>, and then blocks the current activity until the start
      of the next phase, <em>viz</em>, until all other activities registered on that
      clock have called <b>c.resume()</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> It may <em>block</em> on all the clocks it is registered with
      simultaneously, by the command <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b>.  This, in effect, calls
      <b>c.advance()</b> simultaneously 
      on all clocks <b>c</b> that the current activity is registered with.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Other miscellaneous operations are available as well; see the
      <b>Clock</b> API.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clock operations</h2><a name="sec:clock">
</a>

There are two language constructs for working with clocks. 
<b>async clocked(cl) S</b> starts a new activity registered on one or more
clocks.  <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> blocks the current activity until all the activities
sharing clocks with it are ready to proceed to the next clock phase. 
Clocks are objects, and have a number of useful methods on them as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating new clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:create">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clocks are created using a factory method on <b>x10.lang.Clock</b>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
val c: Clock = Clock.make();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The current activity is automatically registered with the newly
created clock.  It may deregister using the <b>drop</b> method on
clocks (see the documentation of <b>x10.lang.Clock</b>). All activities
are automatically deregistered from all clocks they are registered
with on termination (normal or abrupt).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Registering new activities on clocks</h3>
<a name="sec:clock:register">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

 
 
  
  
  
  <em>
  
<table>

<tr><td align="right">AsyncStatement ::= <b>async</b> ClockedClause<sup>?</sup>&nbsp;Statement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">&#124; <b>clocked</b> <b>async</b> Statement </td></tr>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <b>async</b> statement with a <b>clocked</b> clause of either form, say 
<pre>
  async clocked (c1, c2, c3) S
</pre>
starts a new activity, initially registered with
clocks <b>c1</b>, <b>c2</b>, and <b>c3</b>, and  running <b>S</b>. The activity running this code must
be registered on those clocks. 
Violations of these conditions are punished by the throwing of a
<b>ClockUseException</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If an activity a that has executed <b>c.resume()</b> then starts a
new activity b also registered on <b>c</b> (<em>e.g.</em>, via <b>async
clocked(c) S</b>), the new activity b starts out having also resumed
<b>c</b>, as if it too had executed <b>c.resume()</b>. That is, a and b
are in the same phase of the clock. 
<pre>
// ACTIVITY a
val c = Clock.make();
c.resume();
async clocked(c) {
  // ACTIVITY b
  c.advance();
  b_phase_two();
  // END OF ACTIVITY b
}
c.advance();
a_phase_two();
// END OF ACTIVITY a
</pre>
In the proper execution, a and b both perform
<b>c.advance()</b> and then their phase-2 actions.  
However, if b were not
initially in the resume state for <b>c</b>, there would be a race condition;
b could perform <b>c.advance()</b> and proceed to <b>b_phase_two</b>
before a performed <b>c.advance()</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may check whether or not it is registered on a clock <b>c</b> by
the method call <b>c.registered()</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Note:
X10 does not contain a "register" operation that would allow an activity
to discover a clock in a datastructure and register itself (or another
process) on it. Therefore,
while a clock <b>c</b> may be stored in a data structure by one activity
<b>a</b> and read from it by another activity <b>b</b>, <b>b</b> cannot do much
with <b>c</b> unless it is already registered with it.  In particular, it
cannot register itself on <b>c</b>, and, lacking that registration, cannot
register a sub-activity on it with <b>async clocked(c) S</b>.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming clocks</h3><a name="resume">
</a><a name="sec:clock:resume">
</a>
X10 permits <em>split phase</em> clocks. An activity may wish
to indicate that it has completed whatever work it wishes to perform
in the current phase of a  clock <b>c</b> it is registered with, without
suspending itself altogether. It may do so  by executing 
<b>c.resume();</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may invoke <b>resume()</b> only on a clock it is registered with,
and has not yet dropped (&#167;). A
<b>ClockUseException</b> is thrown if this
condition is violated. Nothing happens if the activity has already invoked a
<b>resume</b> on this clock in the current phase.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancing clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:next">
</a>
An activity may execute the following method call to signal that it is done
with the current phase.
<pre>
Clock.advanceAll();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Execution of this call blocks until all the clocks that the
activity is registered with (if any) have advanced. (The activity
implicitly issues a <b>resume</b> on all clocks it is registered
with before suspending.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> may be thought of as calling <b>c.advance()</b> in parallel for all
clocks that the current activity is registered with.  (The parallelism is
conceptually important: if activities a and b are both
registered on clocks <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>, and a executes
<b>c.advance(); d.advance()</b> while b executes <b>d.advance(); c.advance()</b>,
then the two will deadlock.  However, if the two clocks are waited on in
parallel, as <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> does, a and b will not deadlock.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Equivalently, <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> sequentially calls <b>c.resume()</b> for each
registered clock <b>c</b>, in arbitrary order, and then <b>c.wait()</b> for each
clock, again in arbitrary order.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity blocked on <b>advance()</b> resumes execution once
it is marked for progress by all the clocks it is registered with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.5">
1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:drop">
</a>
An activity may drop a clock by executing <b>c.drop();</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The activity is no longer considered registered with this
clock.  A <b>ClockUseException</b> is thrown if the activity has
already dropped <b>c</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadlock Freedom</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In general, programs using clocks can deadlock, just as programs using loops
can fail to terminate.  However, programs written with a particular syntactic
discipline <em>are</em> guaranteed to be deadlock-free, just as programs which
use only bounded loops are guaranteed to terminate.  The syntactic discipline
is: 

<ul>
<li> The <b>advance()</b> instance method shall not be called on any clock.
      (The 
      <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b> method is allowed for this discipline.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Inside of <b>finish{S}</b>, all clocked <b>async</b>s shall be in the scope
      an unclocked <b>async</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>
X10 does not enforce this discipline.  Doing so would exclude useful programs,
many of which are deadlock-free for reasons more subtle than the
straightforward syntactic discipline.  Still, this discipline is useful for
simple cases. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first clause of the discipline prevents a deadlock in which an activity
is registered on two clocks, advances one of them, and ignores the other. 
The second clause prevents the following deadlock.  
<pre>
val c:Clock = Clock.make();
async clocked(c) {                // (A) 
      finish async clocked(c) {   // (B) Violates clause 2
            Clock.advanceAll();   // (Bnext)
      }
      Clock.advanceAll();         // (Anext)
}
</pre>
<b>(A)</b>, first of all, waits for the <b>finish</b> containing <b>(B)</b> to
finish.  
<b>(B)</b> will execute its <b>advance</b> at <b>(Bnext)</b>, and then wait for all
other activities registered on <b>c</b> to execute their <b>advance()</b>s.
However, <b>(A)</b> is registered on <b>c</b>.  So, <b>(B)</b> cannot finish
until <b>(A)</b> has proceeded to <b>(Anext)</b>, and <b>(A)</b> cannot proceed
until <b>(B)</b> finishes. Thus, this causes deadlock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Program equivalences</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that <b>Clock.advanceAll(); Clock.advanceAll();</b> is not the same as <b>Clock.advanceAll();</b>. The
first will wait for clocks to advance twice, and the second
once.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clocked Finish</h2>




<a name="ClockedFinish">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the most common case of a single clock coordinating a few behaviors, X10
allows coding with an implicit clock.  <b>finish</b> and <b>async</b> statements
may be qualified with <b>clocked</b>.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A <b>clocked finish</b> introduces a new clock.  It executes its body in the
usual way that a <b>finish</b> does- except that, when its body completes,
the activity executing the <b>clocked finish</b> drops the clock, while it
waits for asynchronous spawned <b>async</b>s to terminate.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A <b>clocked async</b> registers its async with the implicit clock of
the surrounding <b>clocked finish</b>.   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The bodies of the <b>clocked finish</b> and <b>clocked async</b>
statements  may use the
<b>Clock.advanceAll()</b> 
method call to advance the implicit clock.  Since the implicit clock is not
available in a variable, it cannot be manipulated directly. (If you want to
manipulate the clock directly, use an explicit clock, not a <b>clocked finish</b>.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following code starts two activities, each of which perform their first
phase, wait for the other to finish phase 1, and then perform their second
phase.  
<pre>
clocked finish {
  clocked async {
     phase(&#196;", 1);
     Clock.advanceAll();
     phase(&#196;", 2);
  }
  clocked async {
     phase("B", 1);
     Clock.advanceAll();
     phase("B", 2);
  }
}
</pre>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clocked finishes may be nested.  The inner <b>clocked finish</b> operates in a
single phase of the outer one.
