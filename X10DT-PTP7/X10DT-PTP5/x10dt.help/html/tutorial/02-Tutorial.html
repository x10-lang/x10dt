<h1>Getting Started With Concurrency</h1>

<p> The point of X10 is concurrent programming: giving you great power and
control over your multiprocessor. There's a lot to the sequential language
that we haven't covered, but other languages do sequential computing just as
well as X10. Let's write a program that does something concurrent.
</p>

<h2>Warning About Concurrency</h2>

<p>
Concurrency is hard, and shared-memory concurrency (which X10 does) is very
hard. The main reason for doing concurrency at all is performance: if you want
your program to run ten times as fast, one good way to do it nowadays is to
buy ten processors and have each of them do a tenth of the work.
</p>

<p>
Some languages and systems try to automatically make code concurrent.  That's
great when it works.  Often, it doesn't work: automatically-parallelized code
isn't as good as parallelized code written by a skilled programmer.
Eventually, perhaps, it will be, but probably not for a while.
</p>

<p>
X10 is a language which lets you write good concurrent code.  You can work in
high-level terms, thinking about things like "atomic sections" and "logical
clocks", which are good for writing and understanding concurrent programs. You
don't have to work with lower-level concepts like "threads" and "locks", which
are much harder to deal with.  So, coding in X10 will generally be easier than
doing the same concurrent task in Java or C++.
</p>



<h2>Concurrent "Hello, World"</h2>

<p> The first program we'll make concurrent is, of course, "Hello, World".
We'll write a version of the program which prints that phrase in three
different languages, concurrently.  
</p>

<p>
Now, it actually makes no sense to do this from any practical point of view,
but there are about six things we need to discuss before we can do <a
href="#para-sum"><span class="todo">something sensible</span></a>.  "Hello, World" lets us do half of them.
</p>

<p> If you're not used to concurrent programming, this will look surprisingly
painful and complicated. That's the fault of concurrent programming, not X10.
If you <i>are</i> used to concurrent programming in Java or C++, this will
look surprisingly painless and simple. 
</p>


<p>
X10 makes heavy use of <i>activities</i>.  In other languages, these might
be called <i>threads</i> or <i>processes</i>.  There may be many activities
running at a single place (think: on a single processor).  If there are many
places, each one will have different activities running there.
</p>

<p>
Making an activity in X10 is quite easy.  The command <kbd>async S</kbd>
spawns a new activity which
executes <kbd>S</kbd> and then stops.  The new activity is located at the same
place as the spawner -- they have the same value of <kbd>here</kbd>. 
There are various restrictions on what
can go in <kbd>S</kbd> and ways for <kbd>S</kbd> to coordinate and communicate
with other activities, but we don't need those for concurrent "Hello, World".  
</p>

<p>
So here's a first attempt.  (It won't work right.)
</p>


<!--
import x10.io.Console;

public class ConcHello1 {
  public static def main(argv:Rail[String]!) {
    async Console.OUT.println("Hello, World");
    async Console.OUT.println("Bore Da, Byd");
    async Console.OUT.println("Bonjour, Monde");
  }
}

<p>
Well, <i>that</i> didn't work.
</p>

<p>
This illustrates the central pitfall of concurrency, which sounds obvious, but
isn't: 
</p>
<blockquote class="xiom">
<b>Xiom:</b> In concurrent programs, lots of stuff is happening at the same time.
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case, the attempts to print the English <kbd>"Hello, World"</kbd> and
French <kbd>"Bonjour, Monde"</kbd> were going at the same time.  X10 let
French go for one character (<kbd>B</kbd>), then English for three
(<kbd>Hel</kbd>), then French for two (<kbd>on</kbd>), and so on.  Somehow the
Welsh got delayed to the end.  
</p>

<a name="02-footnote-1-back"></a><p>
Most concurrent programs (in nearly all languages) are buggy <a href="#02-footnote-1">(1)</a>because there's
some way that activities (threads, processes, etc.) can execute that will do
the wrong thing.  Here it's pretty obvious.  In most programs, the bad
schedule doesn't happen very often, and the bugs can be latent for years.  
</p>



<h3>Atomic Power</h3>

<p>
What we need is to have each <kbd>println</kbd> happen <i>atomically</i>.
That means that, once one activity has started doing its <kbd>println</kbd>,
no other activity will get in its way -- once it has started, it will finish.
So, rather than <i>interleaving</i> the printing of the English and French,
X10 will print one of them, then another, then a third.
</p>

<p>
(The program will still be <i>nondeterministic</i>.  Any one of the three
activities might get to go first.  If we wanted them to go
English-Welsh-French, we would do them sequentially, without the <kbd>async</kbd>s.)
</p>

<p> X10's basic mechanism for making things atomic is the <kbd>atomic S</kbd>
block, which executes <kbd>S</kbd> atomically. This might sound obvious, but
it's actually a rarity among programming languages. Java, for example, uses
monitors on all objects, and you need to do some careful programming to use
them. X10's approach is somewhat easier. </p>

<p>
There are some restrictions on what can go in  <kbd>atomic S</kbd>.
When X10 does this, it stops other activies that might interfere with
<kbd>S</kbd>.  So, if <kbd>S</kbd> takes a long time (like forever, say), a
bunch of other activities will be stopped for a long time (also forever) --
through no fault of their own.   This is generally a Bad Thing.  So, X10
forbids commands that might <i>block</i>: that is, that might wait
indefinitely for something else.  
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, <kbd>println</kbd> is a blocking command: the console isn't
always ready to take a message, and there is no guaranteed bound on how long
it will wait. (The compiler makes a pretty good analysis of what is allowed;
see <span class="todo">Unwritten Chapter on atomic</span>.) This is a shame;
otherwise we could write code like <kbd> async atomic
Console.OUT.println("Hello, World"); </kbd>, and we'd be done. See
<kbd>ConcHello2.x10</kbd> for this failed attempt.</p>  

<a name="using-atomic"></a>
<h2>Using Atomic Power Safely</h2>

<p>
When you write an <kbd>atomic S</kbd> command, try to have as little code as
possible inside of <kbd>S</kbd>.  The more code in <kbd>S</kbd>, the worse
your program will tend to perform.  (The same advice goes for any concurrent
language and locking.  Conversely, make sure that you have <i>enough</i> code
in your <kbd>atomic</kbd> blocks.  Leaving things non-atomic that should be
atomic gives you bugs.)
</p>

<p>
A good approach to "little code" is to have one simple assignment to a
variable.   So, what we'll do is, have a buffer -- a String-valued variable --
and asynchronously, atomically append each translation of "Hello, World" to
it.    When we're done, we'll print the buffer.
</p>

<p> For subtle reasons, X10 doesn't exactly let us have a <i>variable</i>
here. Asynchronous activities (like threads and anonymous objects in Java,
say) can refer to <i>constants</i>, but not <i>variables</i>. There's an
established idiom to sneak around this restriction: instead of a
<kbd>String</kbd> variable, use a one-element <kbd>Rail[String]</kbd> -- that
is, an array with one element.  The Rail is constant (in the sense that its
location never changes, which is what the asynchronous activities would have
trouble with), but its contents are allowed to change.
</p>

<h4>Running <kbd>ConcHello3</kbd></h4>
We can compile and run <kbd>ConcHello3</kbd>, and it usually seems to work fine.
<pre class="output">
% x10c ConcHello3.x10
% x10 ConcHello3
Hello, World
Bore Da, Byd
Bonjour, Monde
</pre>

<p>
Once in a while, the activities happen in a different order.  This is
perfectly normal and nothing to be worried about.  Asynchronous activities are
allowed to happen in whatever order they want, unless we somehow tell them
otherwise: 
</p>
<pre class="output">
% x10c ConcHello3.x10
% x10 ConcHello3
Bonjour, Monde
Bore Da, Byd
Hello, World
</pre>

<h4>Running <kbd>ConcHello3</kbd> When It Goes Wrong</h4>

<p>
However, sometimes some of the greetings get left off altogether: 
</p>
<pre class="output">
% x10c ConcHello3.x10
% x10 ConcHello3
Bore Da, Byd
</pre>

<p>
This is wrong!
</p>

<p>
It's wrong in a pretty characteristic way for asynchrony: you could have this
bug in any language.  Our program starts off with the main activity running.
The main activity spawns off three sub-activities, for English, Welsh, and
French.  So, there are <i>four</i> activities happening.  
</p>

<p>
And they happen independently.  They can go in any order.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, the main activity will be allowed to go quickly, and it will get to
the <kbd>println</kbd> before the other ones are all finished.   When this
happens, some of the greetings won't get appended onto the buffer <i>until
after the buffer is printed</i>.  So, those greetings don't get printed.
</p>

<p>
So, we need to make sure that all the sub-activities have finished before we
print the final message. 
</p>

<p>
In many concurrent languages, this is a groanworthy problem, involving locks
or clocks or semaphores or something.  
</p>

<p>
In X10, it's easy.  The command <kbd>finish S</kbd> evaluates <kbd>S</kbd>,
and then waits for all of <kbd>S</kbd>'s sub-activities (and
sub-sub-activities, sub-sub-sub-activities, etc.) to finish.  Then, and only
then, does <kbd>finish</kbd> finish.
</p>

<p>
So, the X10 idiom for starting a bunch of asynchronous computations and
waiting for them to all finish is simply: 
</p>
<pre>
   finish {
     async Computation1;
     async Computation2;
     async Computation3;
   }
</pre>

<p>
And, for our example, that is: 
</p>

<p>
And this program is correct!
</p>
<pre class="output">
% x10 ConcHello4
Hello, World
Bonjour, Monde
Bore Da, Byd
</pre>

<p>
And, because of that <kbd>finish</kbd>, it will never leave out one of the greetings.
</p>

<h2>Summary of Concurrency</h2>

<p>
Many X10 concurrent programs can be built on just three X10 primitives: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>async S</kbd> to spawn asynchronous activities.</li>
<li><kbd>atomic T</kbd> to make sure that only one activity at a time modifies
shared data structures.</li>
<li><kbd>finish U</kbd> to spawn a bunch of activities and wait until they all
finish.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, shared data structures can be things like <kbd>Rail[String]</kbd>s,
providing a place to store a bit of mutable data.
</p>

<h1>The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same</h1>

<p>
X10 has two keywords for introducing new variables.  <kbd>var</kbd> introduces
a variable that you can assign to; <kbd>val</kbd> introduces one that you
cannot change.  The core syntax for the two is parallel: 
</p>

<pre class="ex">
    val a : Int = 1;
    var b : Int = 2;
    b += a;
</pre>

<p>
<kbd>a</kbd> is a <kbd>val</kbd>, meaning that it can't be
changed.  An assignment like <kbd>a += b;</kbd> would be illegal. <kbd>b</kbd>
is a <kbd>var</kbd>, meaning that it can be changed.  <kbd>b += a</kbd> is
legal. 
</p>

<h2>Shorter Forms of <kbd>val</kbd></h2>

<p>
<kbd>val</kbd> can be abbreviated in two ways.  First, the <kbd>val</kbd> is
optional, if the type is provided: 
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    c : Int = 3;
</pre>

<p>
Second, the type is optional if <kbd>val</kbd> is provided.  In this case, the
type will be exactly the type of the expression.  
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    val d = 4;
</pre>
<p>
This gives <kbd>d</kbd> the same type as <kbd>4</kbd> -- which
is <kbd>Int{self==4}</kbd>, not just <kbd>Int</kbd>.  This is particularly
relevant when you assign to an object: 
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    val e = Rail.make[Int](10);
</pre>
<p>
gives <kbd>e</kbd> the type <kbd>x10.lang.Rail[x10.lang.Int]{self==e,
    e.length==10, e.home==_place2}</kbd>.  This type records everything that
    X10 knows about <kbd>e</kbd> -- what variables it's equal to, how long it
is, and where it lives. 
</p>

<p>
Note that, if you <i>do</i> write the type down, X10 (as of version 2.0.3)
will use the type you wrote, rather than the more exact type that it could
have inferred.  If you have a method <kbd>takeTen(x)</kbd> which requires a
Rail of length exactly 10:
</p>
<pre class="ex">
  static def takeTen(Rail[Int]{length==10}) = "Yay ten!";
</pre>
<p>
Then you can call <kbd>takeTen(e)</kbd> without any trouble, but if you have:
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    val f : Rail[Int] = Rail.make[Int](10);
</pre>
<p>
Then calling <kbd>takeTen(f)</kbd> will not compile
(with <kbd>-STATIC_CALLS</kbd>, at least).  
</p>

<h2>Approximate Types in <kbd>val</kbd></h2>

<p>
X10's <kbd>val</kbd> statement allows an <i>approximate type bound</i>, which
use a <kbd>&lt;:</kbd> rather than simply <kbd>:</kbd>.  You
can write a less precise type, like <kbd>Rail[Int]</kbd>, and still get X10 to
use the more precise type with all the constraints: 
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    val g <: Rail[Int] = Rail.make[Int](10);
    takeTen(g);
</pre>

<p>
In general, this makes sure that the type you have written for <kbd>g</kbd>
is <i>correct</i>, but it uses the full type that it infers. 
</p>

<p>
If you are using types in <kbd>val</kbd> statements, we strongly recommend
that you use <kbd>&lt;:</kbd> rather than <kbd>:</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Shorter forms of <kbd>var</kbd></h2>

<p>
<kbd>var</kbd> can't support the same short forms, because it does different
things.  However, it has a different short form.
</p>

<p>
First of all, it can't do type inference the same way that <kbd>val</kbd>
does. Recall that <kbd>val d = 4;</kbd> gave <kbd>d</kbd> the
type <kbd>Int{self==4}</kbd>; that is, an integer whose value is 4.
If <kbd>var h = 4</kbd> were to do the same thing with a <kbd>var</kbd>, it
would give <kbd>h</kbd> the type <kbd>Int{self==4}</kbd> -- that is, the only
value you could ever assign to <kbd>h</kbd> is 4.  That makes it pretty
useless as a <kbd>var</kbd>.  
</p>
<p>
So, X10 doesn't do type inference on <kbd>var</kbd>s -- yet.  A future version
might do some inference, though it will have to be a different kind of
inference than is done for <kbd>val</kbd>.  
</p>

<p>
However, <kbd>var</kbd> doesn't require an initializer.  You don't need to
initialize a <kbd>var</kbd> when you create it; you simply need to give it a
value before you first try to <i>read</i> it.  So, suppose you have: 
</p>
<pre class="ex">
  static def use(a:Int) = 1;
</pre>
<p>
The code 
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    var i : Int;
    use(i);
</pre>
<p>
doesn't compile, because <kbd>i</kbd> doesn't have a value when it is used.
However, if it is obvious to X10 that <kbd>i</kbd> <i>has</i> been given a
value before it is used, that's OK.  The following code works,
because <kbd>i</kbd> will be assigned to before it is used, even though we
don't know until runtime which assignment will be taken.
</p>
<pre class="ex">
    var i : Int;
    if (a < b) i = a; else i = b;
    use(i);
</pre>

<h2>Using <kbd>var</kbd> and <kbd>val</kbd></h2>

<p>
There are a few guidelines for using <kbd>var</kbd> and <kbd>val</kbd> in X10.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <kbd>val</kbd> whenever you can, which should be nearly all the
  time.  <kbd>val</kbd>s can be used in ways that <kbd>var</kbd>s can't
  (<i>e.g.,</i> they can be captured by functions), and the compiler can
  optimize them better. 
</li>
<li>Use <kbd>var x ...</kbd> <i>only</i> when you mean for the value
  of <kbd>x</kbd> to change.    
  (If, somehow, you declared <kbd>x</kbd> to be <kbd>val</kbd> and need it to
  be <kbd>var</kbd> later on, it's only a one-character change.)
</li>
<li>If you give a <kbd>val</kbd> a type, use <kbd>&lt;:</kbd>.  This lets X10
  use all the information that it knows about, while documenting to yourself
  and X10 what you know the variable ought to be. 
</li>
</ol>
