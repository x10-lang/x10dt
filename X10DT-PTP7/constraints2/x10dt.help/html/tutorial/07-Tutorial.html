<h1>Objects and Places</h1>


<!-- 
 * Objects have a home -- where created.
 * method and field refs at home
 * normal and -STATIC_CALLS mode.
 * Remote references.
 * at() to get to where object lives.
 * global fields   
 * global methods
 -->

<h1><kbd>home</kbd> is where the heart is</h1>

<p>
Every object lives in a particular place. (This is not true of other things,
like structs and numbers -- they live everywhere.) Activities running at an
object's home have special privileges that remote activities do not.  This is
an important feature for efficiency -- the more you can keep data in its
proper place, the less you will have to spend on communication and distributed
storage.  
</p>

<p>
An object's home is recorded in its <kbd>home</kbd> property. Objects always
live in the place that they are created. So, if you want a <kbd>Penguin</kbd>
created over <kbd>there</kbd>, go over <kbd>there</kbd> with
an <kbd>at</kbd>-statement and create one, like this:
</p>
<pre class="ex">
  val x = new Penguin();
  // x.home == here
  val there : Place = here.next();
  val y = at(there) new Penguin();
  // y.home == there
</pre>

<h1>Do try this at home</h1>

<p>
When you are manipulating an object from its home place, you can do anything
to it that its access controls allow.  When you are manipulating it from
anywhere else, you can only use fields and methods marked <kbd>global</kbd>.  
</p>



<p>
The X10 2.0.3 compiler lets you choose one of two modes.  The normal mode will
compile method calls, but put in runtime checks to make sure that you're doing
them from the right place (if it can't figure out that you are).  So, you can
be casual about keeping track of homes of objects, but you will pay a bit of
runtime overhead and the occasional runtime failure when you get it wrong.
The <kbd>-STATIC_CALLS</kbd> mode requires you to prove to the compiler that
all calls of local methods are made from the right place: more programming
work, but faster code and no chance of runtime failures on that point.
