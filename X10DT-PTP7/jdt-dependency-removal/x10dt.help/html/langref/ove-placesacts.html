3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Places and activities</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The full power of X10 starts to emerge with concurrency.
An X10 program is intended to run on a wide range of computers,
from uniprocessors to large clusters of parallel processors supporting
millions of concurrent operations. To support this scale, X10
introduces the central concept of <em>place</em> (&#167;).
A place can be thought of as a virtual shared-memory multi-processor:
a computational unit with a finite (though perhaps changing) number of
hardware threads and a bounded amount of shared memory, uniformly
accessible by all threads.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An X10 computation acts on <em>values</em>(&#167;) through
the execution of lightweight threads called
<em>activities</em>(&#167;). 
An <em>object</em>
 has a small, statically fixed set of fields, each of
which has a distinct name. A scalar object is located at a single place and
stays at that place throughout its lifetime. An <em>aggregate</em> object has
many fields (the number may be known only when the object is created),
uniformly accessed through an index (<em>e.g.</em>, an integer) and may be distributed
across many places. The distribution of an aggregate object remains unchanged
throughout the computation, thought different aggregates may be distributed
differently. Objects are garbage-collected when no longer useable; there are
no operations in the language to allow a programmer to explicitly release
memory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 has a <em>unified</em> or <em>global address space</em>. This means that
an activity can reference objects at other places. However, an activity may
synchronously access data items only in the current place, the place in which
it is running. It may atomically update one or more data items, but only in
the current place.   If it becomes necessary to read or modify an object at
some other place <b>q</b>, the <em>place-shifting</em> operation <b>at(q)</b> can
be used, to move part of the activity to <b>q</b>.   It is easy to compute
across multiple places, but the expensive operations (<em>e.g.</em>, those which require
communication) are readily visible in the code. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Atomic blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 has a control construct <b>atomic S</b> where <b>S</b> is a statement with
certain restrictions. <b>S</b> will be executed atomically, without
interruption by other activities. This is a common primitive used in
concurrent algorithms, though rarely provided in this degree of generality by
concurrent programming languages.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More powerfully - and more expensively - X10 allows conditional atomic
blocks, <b>when(B)S</b>, which are executed atomically at some point when
<b>B</b> is true.  Conditional atomic blocks are one of the strongest
primitives used in concurrent algorithms, and one of the least-often
available. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Asynchronous activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An asynchronous activity is created by a statement <b>async S</b>, which starts
up a new activity running <b>S</b>.  It does not wait for the new activity to
finish; there is a separate statement (<b>finish</b>) to do that.
