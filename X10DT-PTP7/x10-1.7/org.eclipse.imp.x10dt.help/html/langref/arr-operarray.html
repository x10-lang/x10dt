5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations on arrays</h2>
In the following let &#228;" be an array with distribution "D" and
base type "T". &#228;" may be mutable or immutable, unless
indicated otherwise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Element operations</h3>
The value of &#228;" at a point "p" in its region of definition is
obtained by using the indexing operation &#228;(p)". This operation
may be used on the left hand side of an assignment operation to update
the value. The operator assignments &#228;(i) op= e" are also available
in  X10.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For array variables, the right-hand-side of an assignment must
have the same distribution "D" as an array being assigned. This
assignment involves
control communication between the sites hosting "D". Each
site performs the assignment(s) of array components locally. The
assignment terminates when assignment has terminated at all
sites hosting "D".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant promotion</h3><a name="ConstantArray">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For a distribution "D" and a constant or final variable "v" of
type "T" the expression &#196;rray.make[T](D, (p: Point) =&#62; v)"
denotes the mutable array with
distribution "D" and base type "T" initialized with "v"
at every point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.3">
5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Restriction of an array</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let "D1" be a sub-distribution of "D". Then &#228;  |  D1"
represents the sub-array of &#228;" with the distribution "D1".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Recall that a rich set of operators are available on distributions
() to obtain sub-distributions
(e.g. restricting to a sub-region, to a specific place etc).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.4">
5.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembling an array</h3>
Let &#228;1,a2" be arrays of the same base type "T" defined over
distributions "D1" and "D2" respectively. Assume that both
arrays are value or reference arrays. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Assembling arrays over disjoint regions&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If "D1" and "D2" are disjoint then the expression &#228;1  | |  a2" denotes the unique array of base type "T" defined over the
distribution "D1  |  |  D2" such that its value at point "p" is
&#228;1(p)" if "p" lies in "D1" and &#228;2(p)"
otherwise. This array is a reference (value) array if &#228;1" is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Overlaying an array on another&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
The expression
&#228;1.overlay(a2)" (read: the array &#228;1" <em>overlaid with</em> &#228;2")
represents an array whose underlying region is the union of that of
&#228;1" and &#228;2" and whose distribution maps each point "p"
in this region to "D2(p)" if that is defined and to "D1(p)"
otherwise. The value &#228;1.overlay(a2)(p)" is &#228;2(p)" if it is defined and &#228;1(p)" otherwise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This array is a reference (value) array if &#228;1" is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The expression &#228;1.update(a2)" updates the array &#228;1" in place
with the result of &#228;1.overlay(a2)".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.5">
5.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Global operations </h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Pointwise operations&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a name="ArrayPointwise">
</a>
The unary "lift" operation applies a function to each element of
an array, returning a new array with the same distribution.
The "lift" operation is implemented by the following method
in &#196;rray[T]":
<pre>
def lift[S](f: (T) =&#62; S): Array[S](dist);
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The binary "lift" operation takes a binary function and
another
array over the same distribution and applies the function
pointwise to corresponding elements of the two arrays, returning
a new array with the same distribution.
The "lift" operation is implemented by the following method
in &#196;rray[T]":
<pre>
def lift[S,R](f: (T,S) =&#62; R, Array[S](dist)): Array[R](dist);
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Reductions&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a name="ArrayReductions">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let "f" be a function of type "(T,T)=&#62;T".  Let
&#228;" be a value or reference array over base type "T".
Let &#252;nit" be a value of type "T".
Then the
operation &#228;.reduce(f, unit)" returns a value of type "T" obtained
by performing "f" on all points in &#228;" in some order, and in
parallel.  The function "f" must be associative and
commutative.  The value &#252;nit" should satisfy
"f(unit,x)" "==" "x" "==" "f(x,unit)".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This operation involves communication between the places over which
the array is distributed. The  X10 implementation guarantees that
only one value of type "T" is communicated from a place as part of
this reduction process.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Scans&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a name="ArrayScans">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let "f" be a reduction operator defined on type "T". Let
&#228;" be a value or reference array over base type "T" and
distribution "D". Then the operation &#228; -  - f()" returns an array
of base type "T" and distribution "D" whose ith element
(in canonical order) is obtained by performing the reduction "f"
on the first i elements of &#228;" (in canonical order).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This operation involves communication between the places over which
the array is distributed. The  X10 implementation will endeavour to
minimize the communication between places to implement this operation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other operations on arrays may be found in "x10.lang.Array" and
other related classes.
