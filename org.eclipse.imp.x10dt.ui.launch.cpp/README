1) Dependencies

In order to compile this plugin, you need PTP.
You can take the plugins listed in the MANIFEST from 
  :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/tools 
under "org.eclipse.ptp" folder.
(However, you should get the ptp_3_0 branch since HEAD is now ptp 4.0 which requires Helios/3.6 and CDT 7.0)
In such case, you will also need to take the CDT dependencies from the same repository under "org.eclipse.cdt" folder.

Better recommendation:
Another alternative is to install PTP on your target platform. For that you will need to install the latest version of PTP 
(I recommend at least 3.0.1 from http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/builds/3.0.1) and follow the instructions at the next 
following page: http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/release_notes/3.0 You don't really need to install RDT.

Eclipse 3.5 is recommended.
