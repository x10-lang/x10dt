1) Dependencies

In order to compile this plugin, you need PTP.
You can take the plugins listed in the MANIFEST from 
  :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/tools 
under "org.eclipse.ptp" folder.
In such case, you will also need to take the CDT dependencies from the same repository under "org.eclipse.cdt" folder.

Another alternative is to install PTP on your target platform. For that you will need to install the latest version of PTP 
(I recommend at least 2.1.2 from http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/builds/2.1.2) and follow the instructions at the next 
following page: http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/release_notes/2.1 You don't really need to install RDT.

Eclipse 3.4 is recommended.
