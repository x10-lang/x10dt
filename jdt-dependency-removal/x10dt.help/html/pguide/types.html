X10's type system is not quite the same as any other object-oriented language, but it is
not really all that different, either.  We'll look at some of the main features here.  We don't
assume that you are familiar with any particular language already, but we do assume that you
have had some experience with at least one object-oriented language.  We'll make references
to Java and C++, since they are so widely taught as a first language,
but only to help compare X10with them.
