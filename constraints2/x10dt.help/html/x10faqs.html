<h2><a name="faq1">How to show compiler options...<a></h2>
<p>
<pre>
$ x10c -- -help
</pre>
will print details of the various compiler options.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq2">How to show where dynamic checks are...<a></h2>
<p>
the compilers shows me how many dynamic checks it inserted:
<pre>
$ x10c DataFlowExample.x10 
x10c: 7 dynamically checked calls or field accesses.
</pre>
Is there a way to tell, where exactly those dynamic checks are?
<br>
You should compile with 
<pre>
-VERBOSE_CALLS=true
</pre>
This will print details of all inserted dynamic casts.

</p>

<h2><a name="faq3">How to show compile time errors...<a></h2>
<p>
As it is, the compiler inserts a dynamic check for you, 
which then fails at runtime.
If you run the compiler with the -STATIC_CALLS flag,
you will get a compile-time error.  
</p>

<!--
<h2><a name="faq4">How to use ! ...<a></h2>
<p>
Every object has a place, that's the point of the PGAS paradigm. You
can access fields and methods of the object only in it's home place. 
Only "global" methods and fields can be accessed everywhere.
</p>
<p>
You should use "!" to make sure you don't have ClassCastException for home
constraints. When you compile your program, you may see the warning: 
ZZZ dynamic checks added. If you compile with the parameter -STATIC_CALLS then 
the compiler will give you errors instead of warnings, and 
you will know what to mark as "!".
</p>
-->

<h2><a name="faq4">Struct initialization...<a></h2>
<p>
For structs you do not need to use "new". Simply write:
<pre>
val x = Pair[Int,Int](3,4);
</pre>
We have a proposal that would allow also using "new" for creating a struct
(which will be more comfortable for Java users).
</p>

<h2><a name="faq5">Using manager and launcher...<a></h2>
<p>
The basic idea is the following.
<ol>
<li>Make a hostlist.txt containing A and B on separate lines
	<ul>
	<li> A
	<li> B
	</ul>
<li>In one window/console/xterm run the command manager hostlist.txt
<li>In a different window/console do: launcher -t 2 HelloWholeWorld
</ol>
<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.
<p>
When you do (3) you should see some output in the manager window
telling you that jobs are starting stopping.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq6">Running x10 programs in more than 1 place...<a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
To run the compiled X10 executable in one place, invoke
<pre>
    bin/runx10 ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<li>
To run in multiple places on Linux, run "bin/manager", and then invoke 
<pre>
    bin/launcher -t &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Refer to <a href="#faq5">using manager and launcher above.</a>
<br><br>
<li>
To run in multiple places on AIX, run
<pre>
  "LAPI_USE_SHMEM=yes poe ./&lt;class_name&gt; -procs &lt;nplaces&gt; -hostfile HOSTFILE".
</pre>
  See "man poe" for additional options and the format of HOSTFILE.
<br><br>
<li>
If you have mpi available, you can use mpirun to run in multiple places.
  Details will vary depending on the exact syntax of the mpirun command,
  but something like this should work:
<pre>  
  mpirun -hostfile &lt;hosts&gt; -n &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
</ul>
