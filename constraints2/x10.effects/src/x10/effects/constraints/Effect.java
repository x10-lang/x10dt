/**
 * The implement of effect annotations.
 * 
 * <p>An effect annotation is either @fun(r,w,a) or @parfun(r,w,a), where r, w, and a are sets 
 * of (mutable) locations.
 * 
 * <p> We use an XTerm to represent a location. 
 * 
 * <p> Two distinct Effects do not share any mutable state except for XTerms that they may 
 * have in common.
 * <p> Effects are created using the Factory.makeEffect(b) method. XTerms should then be added
 * to the read, write and atomicInc sets of the effect.
 * 
 * <p> Effects are composed using the methods: 
 * <ul>
 * <li> followedBy(Effect) (for sequencing and conditionals),
 * <li> exists(XVar) (for local variable declarations), 
 * <li> forall(XVar) (for for loops),
 * <li> makeParFun() (for async), and 
 * <li> makeFun() (for finish), and clone().
 * </ul>
