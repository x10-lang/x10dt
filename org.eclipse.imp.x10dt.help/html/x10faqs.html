<h2><a name="faq1">Conservative build compiler option:<a></h2>
<p>
There is a new compiler option "Conservative Build", which is turned on by default. 
When turned on, this option causes each file that has no generated code in a project 
to be re-submitted for compilation on every build. This ensures that all the files 
that need to be recompiled are indeed compiled when the user saves in an editor, 
and overcomes some shortcomings of the compiler which make it difficult to compute 
dependencies between files. However, this feature is overly conservative, 
an causes the builder to be slower. To make builds faster, this option may be turned off. 
In this case, the user may occasionally observe stale compilation errors. 
This of course can be easily remedied by doing a clean every now and then.

<h2><a name="faq2">Memory usage issues:<a></h2>
<p>

It is best to work only with a few (< 5) editors open at any time, 
because otherwise X10DT becomes very slow.
Due to memory leaks (which we are currently fixing for the next release), 
the system becomes unresponsive after some time (~30mns of usage). 
It is best to restart Eclipse regularly, in order to avoid running out of memory. 
Unfortunately when this happens in eclipse, the workspace could become unusable 
due to corruption of meta-data (or there may be odd behavior). 
So it's best to restart Eclipse regularly and frequently in order to avoid this situation. 
We are working to fix these issues for the next release.
