<h2><a name="faq1">How to show compiler options...<a></h2>
<p>
<pre>
$ x10c -- -help
</pre>
will print details of the various compiler options.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq2">How to show where dynamic checks are...<a></h2>
<p>
the compilers shows me how many dynamic checks it inserted:
<pre>
$ x10c DataFlowExample.x10 
x10c: 7 dynamically checked calls or field accesses.
</pre>
Is there a way to tell, where exactly those dynamic checks are? Maybe
they could be made static with some code changes.
<br>
compile with 
<pre>
-VERBOSE_CALLS=true
</pre>
This will print details of all inserted dynamic casts.

</p>

<h2><a name="faq3">How to show compile time errors...<a></h2>
<p>
As it is, the
compiler inserts a dynamic check for you, which then fails at
runtime.
If you ran the compiler with the -STATIC_CALLS flag,
you would have gotten a compile-time error.  
</p>

<h2><a name="faq4">How to use ! ...<a></h2>
<p>
Every object has a place, that's the point of the PGAS paradigm. You
can access fields and methods of the object only in it's home place. Only
"global" methods and fields can be accessed everywhere.
</p>
<p>
You should use "!" to make sure you don't have ClassCastException for home
constraints. When you compiled your program, you probably saw the warning: 
ZZZ dynamic checks added. If you compile with the parameter -STATIC_CALLS then 
the compiler will give you errors instead of warnings, and you will know what to mark as "!".
</p>

<h2><a name="faq5">Struct initialization...<a></h2>
<p>
For structs you do not need to use "new". Simply write:
<pre>
val x = Pair[Int,Int](3,4);
</pre>
We have a proposal that would allow also using "new" for creating a struct
(which will be more comfortable for Java users).
