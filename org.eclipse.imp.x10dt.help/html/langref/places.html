An X10 place is a repository for data and activities, corresponding
loosely to a process or a processor. Places induce a concept of "local". The
activities running in a place may access data items located at that place with
the efficiency of on-chip access. Accesses to remote places may take orders of
magnitude longer. X10's system of places is designed to make this obvious.
Programmers are aware of the places of their data, and know when they are
incurring communication costs, but the actual operation to do so is easy. It's
not hard to use non-local data; it's simply hard to to do so accidentally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The set of places available to a computation is determined at the time that
the program is started, and remains fixed through the run of the program. See
the <tt>README</tt> documentation on how to set command line and configuration
options to set the number of places.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Places are first-class values in X10, as instances of the built-in struct,
<b>x10.lang.Place</b>.   <b>Place</b> provides a number of useful ways to
query places, such as <b>Place.places</b>, a <b>ValRail</b> of all the places
available to the current run of the program.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Every object <b>ob</b> created by the program has a <em>home place</em>
<b>ob.home</b>. Accesses to <b>ob</b> from activities located at <b>ob.home</b>
are privileged.  Mutable fields can only be changed from <b>ob.home</b>, and
normal fields and methods can only be accessed from there. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
However, objects can be referred to from anywhere.  Places other than
<b>ob.home</b> may have <em>remote references</em> to <b>ob</b>.  Remote references
convey fewer privileges than local ones, but they are far from useless.
Fields and methods can be defined to be <b>global</b>, usable from anywhere.
