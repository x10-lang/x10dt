 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes from X10 v2.0</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul>
<li> &#196;ny" is now the top of the type hierarchy (every object,
  struct and function has a type that is a subtype of
  &#196;ny"). &#196;ny" defines "home", &#228;t", "toString",
  "typeName", &#235;quals" and "hashCode". &#196;ny" also defines the methods
  of &#203;quals", so &#203;quals" is not needed any more.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Revised discussion of incomplete types (&#167;).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The manual has been revised and brought into line with the current implementation.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes from X10 v1.7</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The language has changed in the following way:

<ul>
<li> <b>Type system changes</b>: There are now three kinds of entities
  in an X10 computation: objects, structs and functions. Their
  associated types are class types, struct types and function
  types. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Class and struct types are called <em>container types</em> in that they
  specify a collection of fields and methods. Container types have a
  name and a signature (the collection of members accessible on that
  type). Collection types support primitive equality "==" and may
  support user-defined equality if they implement the <tt>
    x10.lang.Equals</tt> interface. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Container types (and interface types) may be further qualified with
  constraints.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  A function type specifies a set of arguments and their type, the
  result type, and (optionally) a guard. A function application
  type-checks if the arguments are of the given type and the guard is
  satisfied, and the return value is of the given type.  A function
  type does not permit "==" checks. Closure literals create
  instances of the corresponding function type.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Container types may implement interfaces and zero or more function
  types.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  All types support a basic set of operations that return a string
  representation, a type name, and specify the home place of the entity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  The type system is not unitary. However, any type may be used to
  instantiate a generic type. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  There is no longer any notion of "value" classes. "value"
  classes must be re-written into structs or (reference) classes.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> <b>Global object model</b>: Objects are instances of
  classes. Each object is associated with a globally unique
  identifier. Two objects are considered identical "==" if their
  ids are identical. Classes may specify "global" fields and
  methods. These can be accessed at any place. ("global" fields
  must be immutable.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li><b>Proto types.</b> For the decidability of dependent type
  checking it is necessary that the property graph is acyclic. This is
  ensured by enforcing rules on the leakage of "this" in
  constructors. The rules are flexible enough to permit cycles to be
  created with normal fields, but not with properties.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>Place types. Place types are now implemented. This means that
  non-global methods can be invoked on a variable, only if the
  variable's type is either a struct type or a function type, or a
  class type whose constraint specifies that the object is located in
  the current place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  There is still no support for statically checking array access
  bounds, or performing place checks on array accesses.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

Project, which is supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract No. NBCH30390004.</em>
