<a name="StaticInitialization">
</a>

The X10 runtime implements the following procedure to ensure
reliable initialization of the static state of classes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Execution commences with a single thread executing the
<em>initialization</em> phase of an X10 computation at place <b>0</b>. This
phase must complete successfully before the body of the <b>main</b> method is
executed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The initialization phase must be thought of as if it is implemented in
the following fashion: (The implementation may do something more
efficient as long as it is faithful to this semantics.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
Within the scope of a new finish
for every static field f of every class C 
   (with type T and initializer e):
async {
  val l = e; 
  ateach (Dist.makeUnique()) {
     assign l to the static f field of 
         the local C class object;
     mark the f field of the local C 
         class object as initialized;
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
During this phase, any read of a static field <b>C.f</b> (where <b>f</b> is of type <b>T</b>)
is replaced by a call to the method <b>C.read_f():T</b> defined on class <b>C</b>
as follows

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
def read_f():T {
   await (initialized(C.f));
   return C.f;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If all these activities terminate normally, all static field have a
legal value (per their type), and the finish terminates normally. If
any activity throws an exception, the finish throws an
exception. Since no user code is executing which can catch exceptions
thrown by the finish, the exceptions are printed on the console, and
computation aborts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the activities deadlock, the implementation deadlocks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In all cases, the main method is executed only once all static fields
have been initialized correctly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since static state is immutable and is replicated to all places via 
the initialization phase as described above, it can be accessed from
any place.

       graphs can be created without escaping <b>this</b>

<a name="tthFtNtAAC"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>Clearly, a value of type
  <b>proto T</b> cannot be used anywhere that a <b>T</b> is needed,
  since its fields cannot be read.  As discussed below, an incomplete
  value <b>v</b> can be assigned to a field <tt>f</tt> of an object <tt>
    o</tt> only if <tt>o</tt> is incomplete. This ensures that <b>v</b> cannot
  escape through this assignment. A completed value <b>p</b> cannot be
  substituted for <b>o</b> - it may permit <b>v</b> to escape through
  an assignment to its field. Therefore <b>T</b> cannot be a subtype of
  <b>proto T</b>.
