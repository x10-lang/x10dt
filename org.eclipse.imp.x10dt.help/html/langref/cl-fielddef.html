6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Field definitions</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not every instance of a class needs to have every field defined on the
class. In Java-like languages this is ensured by conditionally setting
fields to a default value, such as "null", in those instances where the
fields are not needed.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Consider the class "List" used earlier.  Here all instances of "List"
returned by the second constructor do not need the fields "value" and
"tail"; their value is set to null.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<a name="FieldGuard">
</a> X10 permits a much cleaner solution that does not require default
values such as null to be stored in such fields.  X10 permits fields to
be <em>guarded</em> with a constraint.  The field is accessible
only if the <em>guard</em> constraint is satisified.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is illegal for code to access a guarded field through a reference
whose static type does not satisfy the associated guard, even
implicitly (i.e., through an implicit "this"). Rather the source
program should contain an explict cast, e.g., "me: Cc = this as Cc".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let "f" be a field defined in class
"C" with guard "c".  The compiler declares an error if
field "f" is accessed through a reference &#246;" whose static
type is not a subtype of "Cc".


<div class="p"><!----></div>
We may now rewrite the List example:
<pre>
public class List(n: Intn&#62;=0) 
  protected val headn&#62;0: Object;
  protected val tailn&#62;0: List(n-1);
  public def this(o: Object, t: List): List(t.n+1) 
     property(t.n+1);
     head=o;
     tail=t;
  
  public def this(): List(0) 
     property(0);
  
  ...

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The fields "value" and "tail" do not exist for instances of the class
"List(0)".


<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is a compile-time error for a class to have two fields of the same
name, even if their guards are different. A class "C" with a field
named "f" is said to <em>hide</em> a field in a superclass named "f".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A class may not declare two fields with the same name.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
To avoid an ambiguity, it is a static error for a class to
declare a field with a function type () with
the same name and signature  as a method of the same class.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc6.1">
6.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Field hiding</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A subclass that defines a field "f" hides any field "f"
declared in a superclass, regardless of their types.  The
superclass field "f" may be accessed within the body of
the subclass via the reference &#223;uper.f".
