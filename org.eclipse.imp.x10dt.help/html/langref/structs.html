An instance of a class "C" (an <em>object</em> ) is represented in X10 as
a contiguously allocated chunk of words in the heap, containing the
fields of the object as well as one or more words used in method
lookup (itable/vtable). Variables with base type "C" (or a supertype of
"C") are implemented as cells with enough memory to hold a
<em>reference</em> to the object. The size of a reference (32 bits or 64
bits) depends on the underlying operating system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For many high-performance programming idioms, the overhead of one
extra level of indirection represented by an object is not
acceptable. For instance, a programmer may wish to define a type
"Complex" (consisting of two double fields) and require that instances
of this type be represented precisely as these two fields. A variable
or field of type complex should, therefore, contain enough space to
store two doubles. An array of complex of size "N" should store "2*N"
doubles. Method invocations should be resolved statically so that
there is no need to store vtable/itable words with each
instance. Parameters of type complex should be passed inline to a
method as two doubles. If a method's return type is complex the method
should return two doubles on the stack. Two values of this type should
be equal precisely when the two doubles are equal (structural
equality).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 supports the notion of <em>structs</em> which are precisely
objects that can be implemented inline with a contiguous chunk of
memory representing their fields, without any vtable/itable. Structs
are introduced by struct definitions. struct definitions look very
similar to class definitions, but have additional restrictions.
