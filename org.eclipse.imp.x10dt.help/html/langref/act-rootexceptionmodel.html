<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rooted nature of X10 computations permits the definition of a
<em>rooted</em> exception model. In multi-threaded programming languages
there is a natural parent-child relationship between a thread and a
thread that it spawns. Typically the parent thread continues execution
in parallel with the child thread. Therefore the parent thread cannot
serve to catch any exceptions thrown by the child thread. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The presence of a root activity permits X10 to adopt a different
model.  In any state of the computation, say that an activity A is
<em>a root of</em> an activity B if A is an ancestor of B and A
is suspended at a statement (such as the "finish" statement
&#167;) awaiting the termination of B (and possibly other
activities). For every X10 computation, the
<em>root-of</em> relation
is guaranteed to be a tree. The root of the tree is the root activity
of the entire computation. If A is the nearest root of B, the path
from A to B is called the <em>activation path</em> for the
activity.<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We may now state the exception model for X10.  An uncaught exception
propagates up the activation path to its nearest root activity, where
it may be handled locally or propagated up the <em>root-of</em> tree when
the activity terminates (based on the semantics of the statement being
executed by the activity).<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>  Thus, unlike concurrent languages such as Java, no
exception is "thrown on the floor".
