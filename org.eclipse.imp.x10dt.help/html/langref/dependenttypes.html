Dependent types are a fundamental extension to the type system for
Java-like languages. A dependent type records constraints on
<em>properties</em> (final fields) of the type.  Since types are a fundamental
building block of Java-like languages, the introduction of dependent
types affects many facets of the language simultaneously - the
definition of types, classes, interfaces, methods, constructors,
fields, inheritance, overriding, overloading, and type related
operators (cast, and instanceof).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Indeed dependent types bring substantial expressiveness to Java-like
languages. Just as generic classes permit a single definition for a
class C to be treated as a template for an unbounded number of classes
obtained from C by "instantiating" C with type arguments, so also a
dependent type permits a single definition to produce a potentially
unbounded family of types. That is, just as generic types permit a
programmer to express and use <em>functions</em> from types to types, so also
dependent types permit a programmer to express and use functions from values
to types.  Indeed, the family of types generated from C form a
lattice of subtypes of C, one for each constraint on the properties
of C expressible in the underlying constraint system, but all sharing
the same &#223;tructure".

In  X10 dependent types are checked statically. However, as in
Java-like languages an instanceof relation is available to dynamically
check that an object belongs to a particular (dependent) type. Also a
cast operation is available to force the runtime system to treat an
object o as belonging to a particular dependent type (the operation
throws a ClassCast exception if it is not possible to do so).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dependent types are also the basis for an implicit syntax for
 X10. This is discussed in the last section.
