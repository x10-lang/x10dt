 X10 provides first-class, typed functions, including
<em>closures</em>,
<em>operator functions</em>,
and <em>method selectors</em>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Closure expressions have zero or more type parameters, zero or more
formal parameters, an optional return type and optional set of
exceptions throws by the closure body.  The closure body has the same
syntax as a method body; it may be either an expression, a block of
statements, or a block terminated by an expression to return. In
particular, a value may be returned from the body of the closure using
a return statement (). The type of a closure is a
function type ().

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<a name="ClosureGuard">
</a>As with methods, a closure may declare a guard to
constrain the actual parameters with which it may be invoked.
The guard may refer to the type parameters, formal parameters,
and any final variables in scope at the closure expression.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The body of the closure is evaluated when the closure is
invoked by a call expression (), not at the closure's
place in the program text.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As with methods, a closure with return type "Void" cannot
have a terminating expression. 
If the return type is omitted, it is inferred, as described in
.
It is a static error if the return type cannot be inferred. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following method takes a function parameter and uses it to
test each element of the list, returning the first matching
element.
<pre>
def find[T](f: (T) =&#62; Boolean, xs: List[T]): T = 
  for (x: T in xs)
    if (f(x)) return x;
  null

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The method may be invoked thus:
<pre>
xs: List[Int] = ...;
x: Int = find((x: Int) =&#62; x&#62;0, xs);
</pre>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
As with a normal method, the closure may have a "throws"
clause. It is a static error if the body of the closure throws a
checked exception that is not declared in the closure's "throws"
clause.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Closures are objects</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Closures, like all first-class functions in  X10 are
objects ().
As objects, the closure body may refer to
"this", which is a reference to the current function,
and use it to invoke the closure recursively.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following method uses a closure to compute the nth
Fibonacci number.
<pre>
def fib(n: Int): Int = 
    val f = (n: Int) : Point =&#62; 
        if (n &lt; 1) return [1,0];
        val (r,r1): Point = this(n-1);
        [r+r1,r]
    ;
    val (r,r1): Point = f(n);
    r

</pre>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Outer variable access</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In a closure
"(x<sub>1</sub>: T<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>: T<sub>n</sub>)c =&#62;  s "
the types "T<sub>i</sub>", the guard "c" and the body &#223;"
may access fields of enclosing classes and local variables and type
parameters declared in an outer scope.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Recall that languages such as  Java require that methods may
access only those local variables declared in an enclosing scope
("outer variables") which are final. This is valuable in
preventing accidental races between multiple closures reading
and writing the same outer variable. At the same time, it is
desirable to support the following common idiom of expression:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
def allPositive(c: Collection): Boolean 
  shared var result: Boolean = true;
  c.applyToAll((x: Int) =&#62;  if (x &lt; 0) atomic result=false;);
  return result;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This motivates the following rule:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In an expression
"(x<sub>1</sub>: T<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>: T<sub>n</sub>) =&#62; e",
any outer local variable accessed by &#235;" must be final or
must be declared
as &#223;hared" ().


<div class="p"><!----></div>
The closure body may refer to instances of enclosing classes using
the syntax "C.this", where "C" is the name of the
enclosing class.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The main activity may run in parallel with any
closures it creates. Hence even the read of an outer variable by the
body of a closure may result in a race condition. Since closures are
first-class, the analysis of whether a closure may execute in parallel
with the activity that created it may be difficult.
