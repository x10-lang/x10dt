<h2 id="basic">Basic parts of X10DT</h2>

If you are not already in the X10 Perspective, switch to it now.
To open the X10 Perspective, use the menu Window > Open Perspective > Other  and select X10.
(You can also use the Perspective buttons in the upper right of the Eclipse toolbar.)
<p> 

In the X10 Perspective, you will see the X10 projects in the Package Explorer, the editor, the Outline view,
a Console to show output, etc., and other views.
When you set up how you run your program, you will see the Launch Dialog where you specify how you want
to run the program (see the "Running" section for details).

<h2 id="newproj">Creating an X10 project</h2>
<p>X10 projects can be created using either the Java back-end or the C++ back-end.

<p><a href="02newProjJavaBackend.html">Creating a project with the X10 Java back-end</a> is a good introduction to using X10.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="02newProjCppBackend.html">Creating a project with the C++ backend</a> covers how to create projects that
are compiled and run with C++, including remote projects where the target machine is not the local machine
(a different machine from where Eclipse is running).
