 <h1>X10 Refactoring</h1>

<h2>What is Refactoring?</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a behavior-preserving source-to-source transformation.
As classically defined, refactoring is intended primarily to improve source code maintainability.
<p>The X10 refactorings for concurrency are 
behavior-preserving transformations that can be used to safely improve parallel performance.
<p>
Examples of refactoring for concurrency include:
<ul>
<li>Introduce additional concurrency
<li>Reorganize existing concurrency
<br>E.g., substitute one form of concurrency for another: use clocks for phased computations in lieu of individual activities
<li>Alter data distributions to improve locality
<li>Introduce word-level parallelism (for bit operations)
</ul>

<h2>An X10 Refactoring example</h2>
<p>
<p>Select an area of code, and use the right mouse (context menu) Refactor.
You will see a selection of refactorings that are available.
In this example, "Loop Flat Parallelization" is selected.

The old and proposed new version of the code are show side-by-side.
Differences are indicated by shaded areas.
Select  the "OK" button to accept the changes and modify your source file.
