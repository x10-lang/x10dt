 <h1>X10 Refactoring</h1>

<h2>What is Refactoring?</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a behavior-preserving source-to-source transformation.
As classically defined, refactoring is intended primarily to improve source code maintainability.
<p>A classic simple case of refactoring is the Rename refactoring.
For example, in the X10DT editor, select a local variable or method name.
(To "select", you can double-click on the variable name.  It will be highlighted, shown here with a blue background.)
Then point at this selection and hit the right mouse (bring up the context menu).
Select Refactor > Rename.

<p>In the resulting dialog, change the name of the variable to a new value.
In this example, "result" will be changed to "myval".
<br><img src="images/refactor_rename.png">
<p>If you hit the "Preview" button, the next dialog will show a "before" and "after" version of
the changes to be made.
<br><img src="images/refactor_rename_preview.png">
<p>Click the OK button to accept the changes.
<p>If, after the changes are made, you change your mind, you can always hit "Undo"  (Ctrl-Z  or Mac OSX command-Z).
<h2>Refactoring for Concurrency</h2>
<p>The X10 refactorings for concurrency are 
behavior-preserving transformations that can be used to safely improve parallel performance.
<p>
Examples of refactoring for concurrency include:
<ul>
<li>Introduce additional concurrency
<li>Reorganize existing concurrency
<br>E.g., substitute one form of concurrency for another: use clocks for phased computations in lieu of individual activities
<li>Alter data distributions to improve locality
<li>Introduce word-level parallelism (for bit operations)
</ul>

<h2>An X10 Example of Refactoring for Concurrency</h2>
<p>
<p>Select an area of code, and use the right mouse (context menu) Refactor.
You will see a selection of refactorings that are available.
<p>
In this example, a loop in the code is highlighted, and "Loop Flat Parallelization" is selected.
<p>

<p>On the next dialog, 
if you  check "Verbose," a console will contain information and pre- and post- conditions to the refactoring.
Click "Preview" to see the next screen.
<br><img src="images/refactor_confirm.png">
<p>
The old and proposed new version of the code are show side-by-side.
Differences are indicated by shaded areas.
Note that here, the refactoring has inserted "finish" and "async."

Select  the "OK" button to accept the changes and modify your source file.
