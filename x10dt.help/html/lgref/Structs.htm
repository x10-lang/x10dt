<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 objects are a powerful general-purpose programming tool. However, the
power must be paid for in space and time. In space, a typical object
implementation requires some extra memory for run-time class information, as
well as a pointer for each reference to the object. In time, a typical object
requires an extra indirection to read or write data, and some run-time
computation to figure out which method body to call.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For high-performance computing, this overhead may not be acceptable for all
objects. X10 provides structs, which are stripped-down objects. They are less
powerful than objects; in particular they lack inheritance and mutable fields.
Without inheritance, method calls do not need to do any lookup; they can be
implemented directly. Accordingly, structs can be implemented and used more
cheaply than objects, potentially avoiding the space and time overhead.
(Currently, the C++ back end avoids the overhead, but the Java back end
implements structs as Java objects and does not avoid it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Structs and classes are interoperable. Both can implement interfaces; in
particular, like all X10 values they implement <b>Any</b>.  Subroutines 
whose arguments are defined by interfaces can take both structs and classes.
(Some caution is necessary here: referring to a struct through an interface
requires overhead similar to that required for an object.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In many cases structs can be converted to classes or classes to structs,
within the constraints of structs. If you start off defining a struct and
decide you need a class instead, the code change required is simply changing
the keyword <b>struct</b> to <b>class</b>. If you have a class that does not use
inheritance or mutable fields, it can be converted to a struct by changing its
keyword. Client code using the struct that was a class will need certain
changes: <em>e.g.</em>, the <b>new</b> keyword must be added in constructor calls, and
structs (unlike classes) cannot be <b>null</b>.

All fields of a struct must be <b>val</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A struct <b>S</b> cannot contain a field of type <b>S</b>, or a field of struct
type <b>T</b> which, recursively, contains a field of type <b>S</b>.  This
restriction is necessary to permit <b>S</b> to be implemented as a contiguous
block of memory of size equal to the sum of the sizes of its fields.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Values of a struct <b>C</b> type can be created by invoking a constructor
defined in <b>C</b>.  Unlike for classes, the  <b>new</b> keyword is optional
for struct constructors.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Leaving out <b>new</b> can improve readability in some cases: 
<pre>
struct Polar(r:Double, theta:Double){
  def this(r:Double, theta:Double) {property(r,theta);}
  static val Origin = Polar(0,0);
  static val x0y1   = Polar(1, 3.14159/2);
  static val x1y0   = new Polar(1, 0); 
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When a struct and a method have the same name (often in violation of the X10
capitalization convention), 
<b>new</b> may be used to resolve to the struct's constructor.  
<pre>
struct Ambig(x:Int) {
  static def Ambig(x:Int) = &#228;mbiguity please";
  static def example() { 
    val useMethod      = Ambig(1);
    val useConstructor = new Ambig(2);
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Structs support the same notions of generics, properties, and constrained
types that classes do.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
struct Exam[T](nQuestions:Int){T &lt;: Question} {
  public static interface Question {}
  // ... 
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boxing of structs</h2>



<a name="auto-boxing">
</a> 
If a struct <b>S</b> implements an interface <b>I</b> (<em>e.g.</em>, <b>Any</b>),
a value {v} of type <b>S</b> can be assigned to a variable of type
<b>I</b>. The implementation creates an object <b>o</b> that is an
instance of an anonymous class implementing <b>I</b> and containing
{v}.  The result of invoking a method of <b>I</b> on <b>o</b> is the
same as invoking it on {v}. This operation is termed <em>auto-boxing</em>.
It allows full interoperability of structs and objects-at the cost of losing
the extra efficiency of the structs when they are boxed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In a generic class or struct obtained by instantiating a type parameter
<b>T</b> with a struct <b>S</b>, variables declared at type <b>T</b> in the body
of the class are not boxed. They are implemented as if they were declared at
type <b>S</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The array <b>aa</b> in the following example is an <b>Array[Any]</b>.  It
initially holds two objects.  Then, its elements are replaced by two structs,
both of which are auto-boxed.  Note that no fussing is required to put an
integer into an <b>Array[Any]</b>.  
However, an array of structs, such as <b>ah</b>, holds <em>unboxed</em> structs
and does not incur boxing overhead.
<pre>
struct Horse(x:Int){
  static def example(){
    val aa : Array[Any](1) = [&#228;n Object" as Any, &#228;nother one"];
    aa(0) = Horse(8);
    aa(1) = 13;
    val ah : Array[Horse](1) = [Horse(7), Horse(13)];
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Implementation of <tt>Any</tt> methods</h2>
<a name="StructAnyMethods">
</a>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two
structs are equal (<b>==</b>) if and only if their corresponding fields
are equal (<b>==</b>). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All structs implement <b>x10.lang.Any</b>. 
Structs are required to implement the following methods from <b>Any</b>.  
Programmers need not provide them; X10 will produce them automatically if 
the program does not include them. 
<pre>
  public def equals(Any):Boolean;
  public def hashCode():Int;
  public def typeName():String;
  public def toString():String;  
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A programmer who provides an explicit implementation
of <b>equals(Any)</b> for a struct <b>S</b> should also consider
supplying a definition for <b>equals(S):Boolean</b>. This will often
yield better performance since the cost of an upcast to <b>Any</b> and
then a downcast to <b>S</b> can be avoided.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive Types</h2>















<div class="p"><!----></div>
Certain types that might be built in to other languages are in fact
implemented as structs in package <b>x10.lang</b> in X10. Their methods and
operations are often provided with <b>@Native</b> (&#167;) rather
than X10 code, however. These types are:
<pre>
Boolean, Char, Byte, Short, Int, Long
Float, Double, UByte, UShort, UInt, ULong
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Signed and Unsigned Integers</h3>




<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 has an unsigned integer type corresponding to each integer type:
<b>UInt</b> is an unsigned <b>Int</b>, and so on. These types can be used for
binary programming, or when an extra bit of precision for counters or other
non-negative numbers is needed in integer arithmetic. However, X10 does not
otherwise encourage the use of unsigned arithmetic.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <pre>
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example structs</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>x10.lang.Complex</b> provides a detailed example of a practical struct,
suitable for use in a library.  For a shorter example, we define the
<b>Pair</b> struct.   A <b>Pair</b> packages
two values of possibly unrelated type together in a single value, <em>e.g.</em>, to
return two values from a function.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>divmod</b> computes the quotient and remainder of &#228; &#247; b" (naively).
It returns both, packaged as a <b>Pair[UInt, UInt]</b>.  Note that the
constructor uses type inference, and that the quotient and remainder are
accessed through the <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> fields.
<pre>
struct Pair[T,U] {
    public val first:T;
    public val second:U;
    public def this(first:T, second:U):Pair[T,U] {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }
    public def toString() 
        = "(" + first + ", " + second + ")";
}
class Example {
  static def divmod(var a:UInt, b:UInt): Pair[UInt, UInt] {
     assert b &#62; 0u;
     var q : UInt = 0u;
     while (a &#62; b) {q++; a -= b;}
     return Pair(q, a); 
  }
  static def example() {
     val qr = divmod(22, 7);
     assert qr.first == 3u &amp;&amp; qr.second == 1u;
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nested Structs</h2>



<div class="p"><!----></div>
Static nested structs may be defined, essentially as static nested classes
except for making them structs
(&#167;).  Inner structs may be defined, essentially as
inner classes except making them structs (&#167;).
<b>Limitation: </b> Nested structs must be currently be declared static.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc7">
7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Default Values</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If all fields of a struct have default values, then the struct has a
default value, <em>viz</em>, the struct whose fields are all set to their
default values.  If some field does not have a default value, neither
does the struct.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the following code, the <b>Example</b> struct has a default value whose
<b>i</b> field is <b>0</b>.  If an <b>Example</b> is ever constructed by the
constructor, its <b>i</b> field will be <b>1</b>.  This program does a slightly
subtle dance to get ahold of a default <b>Example</b>, by having an instance
<b>var</b> (which, unlike most kinds of variables, does not need to get
initialized before use (though that exemption only applies if its type has a
default value)).   As the <b>assert</b> confirms, the default <b>Example</b>
does indeed have an <b>i</b> field of <b>0</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
class StructDefault {
  static struct Example {
    val i : Int;
    def this() { i = 1; }
  }
  var ex : Example; 
  static def example() {
     val ex = (new StructDefault()).ex;
     assert ex.i == 0;
  }
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc8">
8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting Between Classes And Structs</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Code written using structs can be modified to use classes, or vice versa.
Caution must be used in certain places. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Class and struct <em>definitions</em> are syntactically nearly identical:
change the <b>class</b> keyword to <b>struct</b> or vice versa.  Of course,
certain important class features can't be used with structs, such as
inheritance and <b>var</b> fields. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Converting code that <em>uses</em> the class or struct requires a certain amount
of caution.
Suppose, in particular, that we want to convert the class <b>Class2Struct</b>
to a struct, and <b>Struct2Class</b> to a class.
<pre>
class Class2Struct {
  val a : Int;
  def this(a:Int) { this.a = a; }
  def m() = a;
}
struct Struct2Class { 
  val a : Int;
  def this(a:Int) { this.a = a; }
  def m() = a;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> Class constructors require the <b>new</b> keyword; struct constructors
      allow  it but do not require it.  
      <b>Struct2Class(3)</b> to will need to be converted to 
      <b>new Struct2Class(3)</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Objects and structs have different notions of <b>==</b>.  
      For objects, <b>==</b> means &#223;ame object"; for structs, it means
      &#223;ame contents". Before conversion, both <b>assert</b>s in the
      following program succeed.  After converting and fixing constructors,
      both of them fail.
<pre>
val a = new Class2Struct(2);
val b = new Class2Struct(2);
assert a != b;
val c = Struct2Class(3);
val d = Struct2Class(3);
assert c==d;
</pre>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Objects can be set to <b>null</b>.  Structs cannot.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The rules for default values are quite different.  
The default value of an object type (if it exists) is <b>null</b>, which behaves quite
differently from an ordinary object of that type; <em>e.g.</em>, you cannot call methods
on <b>null</b>, whereas you can on an ordinary object. The default value for
a struct type (if it exists) is a struct like any other of its type, and you
can call methods on it as for any other.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
