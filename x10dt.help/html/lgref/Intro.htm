Chapter 1 </a><br />Introduction</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The era of the mighty single-processor computer is over. Now, when more
computing power is needed, one does not buy a faster uniprocessor-one buys
another processor just like those one already has, or another hundred, or
another million, and connects them with a high-speed communication network.
Or, perhaps, one rents them instead, with a cloud computer. This gives one
whatever quantity of computer cycles that one can desire and afford.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then, one has the problem of how to use those computer cycles effectively.
Programming a multiprocessor is far more agonizing than programming a
uniprocessor.   One can use models of computation which give somewhat of the
illusion of programming a uniprocessor.  Unfortunately, the models which give
the closest imitations of uniprocessing are very expensive to implement,
either increasing the monetary cost of the computer tremendously, or slowing
it down dreadfully. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One response to this problem has been to move to a <em>fragmented memory
  model</em>. Multiple processors are programmed largely as if they were
uniprocessors, but are made to interact via a relatively language-neutral
message-passing format such as MPI []. This model has enjoyed some
success: several high-performance applications have been written in this
style. Unfortunately, this model leads to a <em>loss of programmer
  productivity</em>: the message-passing format is integrated into the host
language by means of an application-programming interface (API), the
programmer must explicitly represent and manage the interaction between
multiple processes and choreograph their data exchange; large data-structures
(such as distributed arrays, graphs, hash-tables) that are conceptually
unitary must be thought of as fragmented across different nodes; all
processors must generally execute the same code (in an SPMD fashion) etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One response to this problem has been the advent of the <em>
partitioned global address space</em> (PGAS) model underlying languages
such as UPC, Titanium and Co-Array Fortran [,]. These
languages permit the programmer to think of a single computation
running across multiple processors, sharing a common address
space. All data resides at some processor, which is said to have <em>
affinity</em> to the data.  Each processor may operate directly on the
data it contains but must use some indirect mechanism to access or
update data at other processors. Some kind of global <em>barriers</em>
are used to ensure that processors remain roughly synchronized.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 is a modern object-oriented programming language
in the PGAS family. The fundamental goal of X10 is to enable
scalable, high-performance, high-productivity transformational
programming for high-end computers-for traditional numerical
computation workloads (such as weather simulation, molecular dynamics,
particle transport problems etc) as well as commercial server
workloads.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 is based on state-of-the-art object-oriented
programming ideas primarily to take advantage of their proven
flexibility and ease-of-use for a wide spectrum of programming
problems. X10 takes advantage of several years of research (e.g.,
in the context of the Java Grande forum,
[,]) on how to adapt such languages to the context of
high-performance numerical computing. Thus X10 provides support
for user-defined <em>struct types</em> (such as <b>Int</b>, <b>Float</b>,
<b>Complex</b> etc), supports a very
flexible form of multi-dimensional arrays (based on ideas in ZPL
[]) and supports IEEE-standard floating point arithmetic.
Some capabilities for supporting operator overloading are also provided.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 introduces a flexible treatment of concurrency, distribution
and locality, within an integrated type system. X10 extends the
PGAS model with <em>asynchrony</em> (yielding the <em>APGAS</em> programming
model). X10 introduces <em>places</em> as an abstraction for a
computational context with a locally synchronous view of shared
memory. An X10 computation runs over a large collection of places.
Each place hosts some data and runs one or more <em>
activities</em>. Activities are extremely lightweight threads of
execution. An activity may synchronously (and <em>atomically</em>) use
one or more memory locations in the place in which it resides,
leveraging current symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) technology.  
An activity may shift to another place to execute a statement block.
X10 provides weaker ordering guarantees for
inter-place data access, enabling applications to scale.  
Multiple memory locations in multiple places cannot be
accessed atomically.  <em>
Immutable</em> data needs no consistency management and may be freely
copied by the implementation between places.  One or more <em>clocks</em>
may be used to order activities running in multiple
places.  <b>DistArray</b>s, distributed arrays,  may be distributed across
multiple 
places and  support parallel collective operations. A novel
exception flow model ensures that exceptions thrown by asynchronous
activities can be caught at a suitable parent activity.  The type
system tracks which memory accesses are local. The programmer may
introduce place casts which verify the access is local at run time.
Linking with native code is supported.
