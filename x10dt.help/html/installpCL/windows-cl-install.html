<h1>Windows X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Windows, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.2.x or higher (for the X10 C++ backend)</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher (for the X10 Java backend)</li>
</ul>

<a name="gcc-prereq">
<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is not installed with Windows. To get gcc you will need to install the Cygwin package.
The latest version is 1.7.7. There are two ways to do this
<ol>
<li>script installation using the cygwin-install package documented 
under <a href="#batch-cygwin">the batch installation</a> 
<li>interactively using the cygwin installer which is documented 
under <a href="#interactive-cygwin">the interactive installation</a> 
</ol>

<a name="batch-cygwin">
<h4>1. Cygwin batch installation</h5>
We have developed a batch installation of Cygwin that you can downloaded
to install the Cygwin environment.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip">
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip</a>
<p>
You should download this file to a temporary directory, unzip the contents, and
run "cygsetup.bat".   This will prompt you for your windows id so it can create
the login directory and install some cygwin shell files. Also watch out for any
firewall prompts that you may have to respond to.
<p>
Once the installation is complete you should double check that the Windows PATH
environment variable has been updated to include the following directories:
<ul>
<li>C:\cygwin\bin</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the installation is complete you will be in the cygwin directory, and you
can start cygwin by running "cygwin.bat".  
<p>
We have also supplied another batch file called "addpkg.bat" which can be used
to download additional packages.  For example, you might want to download and 
install the unix editors, vim and emacs.  You would do this by running
<pre>
addpkg vim emacs
</pre>
<p>
For those who are interested in compiling the X10 distribution,
we have also supplied another batch file called "addbuildpkgs.bat" which will
download all the packages you need to build the x10 distribution.
<p>
You can now proceed to checking the <a href="#java-prereq">java prereq.</a>


<a name="interactive-cygwin">
<h4>2. Cygwin interactive installation</h5>
To get the base cygwin do the following
<ul>
<li>Go to the cygwin site
  http://www.cygwin.com/
<li>Click on install or update
  The latest Cygwin release is 1.7.1-1
<li>Save the setup file to a local folder, e.g. cygwinInstall
<li>Execute setup.exe
  Allow any firewall rules, if needed
<li>Click next
<li>Select a download source, usually Install from the Internet
<li>Select root install directory, usually C:\cygwin, along with install for All Users, click next
<li>Select local package directory, usually c:\cygwin, click next
<li>Select your internet connection, usually Direct connection, click next
<li>Select a download site, usually one closest to you, click next
<li>Click ok on any setup alerts
<li>Select the packages, usually the defaults to begin with, click next
<li>Select icons, click Finish
</ul>

<p>
Once the default packages have completed installing, you can start cygwin by
doing the following.
<pre>
cd c:\cygwin
cygwin.bat
</pre>
You should see the skeleton files being created for your userid.  The userid is
created from your windows id.

<p>
Once cygwin is working, you should relaunch setup and select the gcc/g++ compiler that
is required by X10. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Devel - 4.3.4-3 - gcc4-g++ G++ subpackage
</pre>

<p>
Select any other packages that you may want. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Utils - util-linux 2.14.1
</pre>

<a name="java-prereq">
<h3>java</h3>
Java is not included by default with Windows. However, nost people will have installed one already.
If not, you should download and install the latest Sun Java runtime or JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
You should install Java in the normal fashion either in "Program Files" or directly at the
root level. Usually you would make this installation your system JVM.
<p>
Cygwin should recognize that you have java installed and use it. The only thing that you should
do is make sure that JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables for X10 to use.
You can do this using the Windows control panel System application.
<pre>
Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
</pre>
Under System variables, check for JAVA_HOME and if not defined, click edit and enter the 
"Variable name" JAVA_HOME and the "Variable value" as the JRE or JDK path. Click Ok to save
your values.
<p>
You should start cygwin and test for Java by doing the following
<pre>
which java
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
</pre>
You should see something like this
<pre>
$ which java
/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/System32/java

$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_11"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode)

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
C:\jdk1.5.0_15
</pre>

<a name="getting-started">
<h2>Getting started</h2>
You need to download the X10 2.1.2 distributions for your platform,
<pre>
AIX/Power
Linux/Power (SLES11)
Cygwin/x86
Linux/x86 (RHEL5)
Linux/x86_64 (RHEL5)
MacOS/x86 and x86_64
</pre>
in this case Windows Cygwin/x86. The Sockets runtime is included in the download.
Go to the <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.2+Release">X10 release 2.1.2 (http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.2+Release)</a> and download
the X10 distribution.  You should save this file in the same location as the cygwin installation directories.
You should check periodically for new releases at http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+Releases.
<p>
Next you need to install the X10 distribution so that it is available to use.  My recommendation is to
make a directory in the /usr/local or /opt tree.  To do this do the following. Note that you may have to use
the "sudo" command to get access.

Start the cygwin bash shell.
<pre>
cd /usr
mkdir local
cd local
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir 2.1.2
</pre>

Make all of these directories accessible by everyone
<pre>
cd /usr
chmod -R 755 local
</pre>

Now copy the x10 download to x10dist directory and unpack it.
<pre>
cp /cygdrive/c/cygwinInstall/x10-2.1.2_cygwin_x86.gz /usr/local/x10/2.1.2
</pre>
and then unpack the x10 distribution.
<pre>
cd /usr
cd local
cd x10
cd 2.1.2
tar -xvf x10-2.1.2_cygwin_x86.gz
</pre>

<p>
Now you are ready to setup your environment that makes use of these directories.
On Cygwin running the bash shell, it is probably better to modify .bash_profile to add the x10 bin directory
to your path.  You can also define aliases here, etc.  You will also need to add the x10 lib directory so the
system knows how to find the cyggc-1.dll file.
<p>
Here is a sample .bash_profile
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/local/x10/2.1.2/bin:/usr/local/x10/2.1.2/lib:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

<p>
Once the installation is complete you should update the Windows PATH
environment variable  to include the following directories:
<ul>
<li>C:\cygwin\bin</li>
</ul>

Now you will be able to use the x10 commands to compile and run your programs.
My recommendation is to make an x10 directory or an x10work directory in your
home path, and create a directory for each project.
<p>
To get started we will copy the HelloWorld program from the x10 samples directory into your
working directory
<pre>
cd ~
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
cp /usr/local/x10/2.1.2/samples/HelloWorld.x10 .
</pre>
<h4>java backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the java backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
You should now see some java classes in your directory.
<pre>
HelloWorld$1.class		HelloWorld$Main.class	HelloWorld.x10
HelloWorld$Main$1.class	HelloWorld.class
HelloWorld$Main$2.class HelloWorld.java
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
x10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>C++ backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the c++ backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=HelloWorld HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
The reason for using the -MAIN_CLASS is so that the compiler generates a
runtime called "HelloWorld". If you leave off the -MAIN_CLASS directive, 
your output will be under a.exe .
<p>
You should now see a .cc and .inc file in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld.cc	HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.h	HelloWorld.inc	HelloWorld.x10
</pre>
<p>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
runx10 HelloWorld.exe
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
Hello World!
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may want to compile the other sample programs from the "samples"
directory.  Then you can begin creating your own programs.

<h4>Running x10 programs using <tt>Sockets</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
The sockets transport replaces <tt>pgas_sockets</tt> (which is closed-source, and requires some setup), and is currently the default backend if you don't compile with the "-x10rt" flag. You set an environment variable <tt>X10_NPLACES</tt> to specify the number of places. If this is not set, it defaults to 1 place on the local machine, and prints a warning. 
There are two ways to specify the machines to run on: 
<ul>
<li>Set the environment variable <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> to the full path for a hostfile. The hostfile is a simple text file that contains a list of hostnames to run on, with one line per machine. 
<li>Set the environment variable <tt>X10_HOSTLIST</tt>, to a comma-separated list of hostnames, without spaces. This environment variable is checked only if <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> was not set. 
</ul>
Both of the above will wrap if there are more places than hostnames specified. For example, setting <tt>X10_NPROCS=4</tt> and <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=host1,host2</tt> will cause places 0 and 2 to run on host1, and places 1 and 3 to run on host2. If neither of the above is set, and there is more than 1 place, then it defaults to running everything on localhost, and prints a warning. You can set <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=localhost</tt> to get the same effect without warning. 
If you're running on more than one machine, you should have public/private key ssh authentication set up, so you can ssh from one machine to another without getting a password prompt. You should also have your executable and hostfile available in the same location on every machine listed in the hostfile. You compile your program with "-x10rt sockets", and with ssh in place, and the environment variables set, you run your executable. You don't have to launch from one of the machines in the hostfile, but you do need to have the ssh authentication set up between the machine you launch from and the first machine in the list. 
<p>
The sockets backend supports gdb debugging through the <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG</tt> environment variable. The value of this has two forms: 
<ul>
<li>"place:port", where place is the place that you want to be debugged or the string "all", and port is the port number that you want gdbserver to use. This launches the runtime for the specified place under gdbserver, which allows you to connect to the remote runtime with your local gdb session. See <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_134.html">this link</a> for more details. If you specify "all" for the place, then all places will be started under gdbserver at the specified port. Be aware that if you have multiple places running on the same machine, then this will cause port number conflicts. 
<li>"place", where place is either the place that you want to be debugged, or the string "all". Setting this to a number causes the specified place to be launched under gdb in a new xterm. For example, setting <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG=0</tt> will cause the x10 runtime for place 0 to be started in a gdb session in a new xterm, while other places run normally. Setting this to "all" will cause all runtimes to execute in separate gdb xterms. Each xterm is given a title showing which place it is running so you can keep track. 
</ul>
If you are running on triloka, please be sure to ssh to each machine in your hostlist to ensure that GSA is mounted and you don't get a password prompt. More than once I've forgotten to do this, and the program appears to hang, when under the covers it's waiting at a password prompt. 
<p>
It's possible to run without the launcher, and start up each place manually. To do this, you need to set the X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME, X10_PLACE, and X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS environment variables, which would normally be set by the launcher. For example: 
<ul>

<li>// Launch three places on triloka1-3, all using port 7001: 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=0 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka1 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=1 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka2 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=2 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka3 
</ul>
Please note that currently, the Sockets backend will not work in an environment with mixed POWER and x86 hardware, due to different endianness. 
<p>

<h4>Running with <tt>Standalone</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
Standalone sets up shared memory regions and forks off one instance of the program per place. The places all run on the local machine. There is one environment variable "X10_NPLACES", which should be set to the number of places. If not set, it defaults to 1 and prints a warning. The standalone has transport has a limit on the size of the data blocks that can be sent (about 512k), because of the shared memory regions. To run, just compile with "-x10rt standalone", set the environment variable, and run your executable. This transport is a good choice if you're running everything one one machine and don't use large messages. 
<p>
Debugging under standalone is relatively easy, since all places are forked off from the main process, and gdb can be configured to follow these forks. 

<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.

<h4>Possible errors</h4>
<p>
If you see an error like this
<pre>
	0; xlupc transport: can't get network address associated with 	listner socket: Device not configured
	Abort trap
</pre>
This means that your ip address is being used by another program and the pgas library cannot
access the ip address using gethostbyname(). Check your /etc/hostconfig file does not contain
a HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts is configured properly.

<p>
If you see this error
<pre>
JAVA_HOME (C:/Program Files/IBM/Java60) is not pointing to a JRE or a JDK
</pre>
It means that you have to define a JAVA_HOME environment variable for X10. You should
refer to the java prereq section above to define this.

<h4>Make your own commands</h4>
You might want to make your own scripts or aliases so that you don't have to remember the exact
syntax. If you create scripts make sure that they are excutable.  If you place them in ~/bin
then you should add this to your PATH in your .bash_profile. You might also want to add
"./" to the beginning of your PATH statement so it will look first in the directory that you are in.
