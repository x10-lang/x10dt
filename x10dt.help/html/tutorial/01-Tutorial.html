<h1>X10 Tutorial</h1>

<p>
X10 is a new programming language,  designed for concurrent, multicore
computing.  It gives you detailed control over where your data is and what you
are doing with it, which is crucial for getting the most out of your multicore
computer.    
</p>

<p>
A lot of X10's concepts should be familiar from Java and C++, though the
details may be somewhat different.  X10 has:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The familiar
  C-style <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Classes and objects</li>
<li>Generics</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Obligatory <code>Hello, World</code></h2>

The program to print "Hello, World" is: 


<!--
//Tutorial file 01/HelloWorld.x10
class HelloWorld {
  public static def main(argv:Rail[String]) {
    x10.io.Console.OUT.println("Hello, World");
  }
}

-->
<table class="ex">
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-1"/><a href="#hello-1" class="ex">1</a></td><td class="ex"><code>//Tutorial file HelloWorld.x10</code></td></tr>
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-2"/><a href="#hello-2" class="ex">2</a></td><td class="ex"><code>class HelloWorld {</code></td></tr>
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-3"/><a href="#hello-3" class="ex">3</a></td><td class="ex"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;public static def main(argv:Rail[String]) {</code></td></tr>
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-4"/><a href="#hello-4" class="ex">4</a></td><td class="ex"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x10.io.Console.OUT.println("Hello, World");</code></td></tr>
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-5"/><a href="#hello-5" class="ex">5</a></td><td class="ex"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></td></tr>
<tr class="ex"><td><a name="src-hello-6"/><a href="#hello-6" class="ex">6</a></td><td class="ex"><code>}</code></td></tr>
</table>

This goes in a file called <kbd>HelloWorld.x10</kbd>.  Compile it with: <br/>
<code >
&nbsp;&nbsp;  x10c HelloWorld.x10
</code><br/>
and then run it with:
<code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  x10 HelloWorld
</code><br/>
and watch it produce the output:<br/>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hello, World
</code>

<p> <a name="hello-1"/> <a href="#src-hello-1">line
1: </a><kbd class="ex">//Tutorial file HelloWorld.x10</kbd><br/>

Comments in X10 are the same as Java or C++. They can begin with <kbd>//</kbd>
and go through the end of the line, or begin with <kbd>/*</kbd> and end
with <kbd>*/</kbd>. For this tutorial, we'll include filenames in our
examples, so that you can find them easily. There's no need or value to doing
this in anything but tutorial code, so don't bother.
</p>


<p> <a name="hello-2"/> <a href="#src-hello-2">line 2: </a><kbd class="ex">class HelloWorld {</kbd><br/>
X10 executable code, as in C++ and Java, lives in classes.  
Often the class will have the same name as its file -- <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd>
  and <kbd>HelloWorld.x10</kbd> in this case. 
</p>
<p> <a name="hello-3"/> <a href="#src-hello-3">line 3: </a><kbd class="ex">
    public static def main(argv:Rail[String]) {</kbd><br/>
As in Java and C++, the program execution starts with the static method
    named <kbd>main</kbd>, which takes the command-line arguments as a
    collection of strings.  But here we start to see the first minor differences
    from Java and C++, though they're cosmetic at this point.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Methods are defined with the keyword <b><kbd>def</kbd></b>.  This makes it
  easy to tell what's a method and what isn't.
</li>
<li>You don't need to give return types for all methods.  Sometimes you do
  need them, 
  but not always.  In this case, the compiler can tell that <kbd>main</kbd>
  doesn't return anything.  It has type <kbd>Void</kbd>, but you don't need
  to write that.</li>
<li>X10 has several choices of built-in collection types.  Some of the fancier
  ones are extraordinariy powerful; <i>e.g.,</i> the <kbd>Array</kbd> type
  describes data spread across multiple processors.  We don't need that sort
  of power here, so <kbd>main</kbd> takes a simple kind of collection:
  a <kbd>Rail</kbd> of strings.  <kbd>Rail</kbd>s are simple vectors, indexed
  by integers.
</li>
<li>X10 has generic types, along the same general lines as Java and C++.
  Instantiating a generic type uses square brackets: <kbd>Rail[String],
  Map[String, Point]</kbd>.  Square brackets aren't used for anything else in
  X10.
</li>
<li>Variable types come after the variable name, with a colon: <kbd>argv :
    Rail[String]</kbd>, or <kbd>i:Int</kbd>.  
</li>
</ol>



<p> 
<a name="hello-4"/> <a href="#src-hello-4">line 4: </a><kbd class="ex">
x10.io.Console.OUT.println("Hello, World");</kbd><br/>
X10's libraries are arranged in packages, much like those of Java.
The <kbd>x10.io</kbd> package contains many input-output
classes.  <kbd>Console</kbd> represents standard input and output,
and <kbd>Console.OUT</kbd> the output side of that.  <kbd>println</kbd> prints
a string. 

</p>
<!--<p> <a name="hello-5"/> <a href="#src-hello-5">line 5: </a><kbd class="ex">  }</kbd><br/></p>-->
<!--<p> <a name="hello-6"/> <a href="#src-hello-6">line 6: </a><kbd class="ex">}</kbd><br/></p>-->


<a name="type-inference"></a>
<h2>Types and Type Inference</h2>


<p>
Like Java and C++, X10 is a <i>strongly-typed</i> language.  Everything has a
type.  The compiler keeps track of the type of everything at compile time.
Certain kinds of errors -- trying to divide a boolean by a string, say -- will
be caught before the program runs.
</p>

<p>
X10's types are richer than those of Java and C++. For example, X10 can say
"<kbd>a</kbd> is an array of three integers", or even "<kbd>a</kbd> is an
array of <kbd>n</kbd> integers", which Java can't express.  This can be quite
helpful.  A matrix-multiply function can check statically that you're
multiplying matrices of compatible shapes.  You can't multiply a 3&times;4 by
a 5&times;6 by mistake in X10, any more than you can you divide a boolean by a string.
</p>

<p>
But every good feature comes with its cost.  Since X10 types can include a lot
of information, they can get pretty long and complicated.  Even C++ and Java
types can get pretty messy, as anyone who has ever written code about maps
from lists of strings to sets of URLs is well aware.  
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, in X10 -- unlike C++ and Java -- you don't always have to write
types by hand. X10 can do <i>type inference</i> in many 
circumstances.  It can figure out what types you must mean, and not require
you to write them. For example, if you want to compute <kbd>13+21</kbd> and call
it <kbd>sum</kbd>, you can write:
</p>
<code class="ex">
   val sum = 13 + 21;
</code>
<p>
X10 will figure out that <kbd>13</kbd> and <kbd>21</kbd>
are <kbd>Int</kbd>s, and <kbd>+</kbd> of two <kbd>Int</kbd>s is
an <kbd>Int</kbd>, so <kbd>sum</kbd> must be an <kbd>Int</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
You can also write the type yourself, if you want to.  (This is a good way to
document your code, to explain to the compiler and future people reading it --
including yourself, a year from now! -- what you meant.)  You could just as
well have written the same line with explicit types: 
</p>
<code class="ex">
   val sum <: Int = 13 + 21;
</code>
<p>
and used the <kbd>: Int</kbd> to say, unambiguously, that you
want <kbd>sum</kbd> to be an integer.  Of course, if your idiot co-worker were
confused about how addition worked, and wrote 
</p>
<code class="ex">
   val sum <: Boolean = 13 + 21;
</code>
<p>
the X10 compiler would give a compile-time error message and refuse to execute
such nonsense.
</p>

<p>
In X10 2.0.3, the <kbd>&lt;:</kbd> symbol is optionally used
with <kbd>val</kbd> to give types. If you want to declare a variable that you
can change, you'll use <kbd>var i : Int = 1;</kbd>, with a <kbd>:</kbd> rather
than a <kbd>&lt;:</kbd>. This fine point will make more sense later (and may
become more uniform in later versions of X10); for now, just take it as an
idiom.
</p>

<p>
There is much more to say about types and variables, but this is enough to
start with.
</p>

<a name="location-location-location"></a>
<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>

<p>
The feature of X10 that will give you the most power, and the most trouble,
is <b>places</b>. A place generally corresponds to a process or processor
(though you can run with more places than processors if you like). Some data
is <i>global</i>, meaning that it can be read from any place. Most data
is <i>non-global</i>: it exists in one place, and, if you want to work with
it, you need to do so at that place. This is quite easy, but you will have to
do it intentionally. </p>

<p>
(<b>Note:</b> In X10, global data is always <i>immutable</i>.  You can create
it, but you can't change it once it is created.  If you want to
have <i>mutable</i> data, changeable storage cells (<i>e.g.</i>, a counter, or
a dictionary), it has to be <i>non-global</i> -- it has to be located in some
specific place.  We'll see how to do that soon.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Advantage:</b> You will always be in control of where your
data lives and your computation is happening.   You will be able to tune your
program for peak performance.  
<b>Disadvantage:</b> You will have to give X10 clues about where data is, or
accept the costs of X10's attempts to find out, even when it's obvious to you.
</p>

<blockquote class="xiom">
<b>Xiom:</b> A place for everything, and everything in its place.
</blockquote>

<p>
X10 has a basic built-in data type <kbd>Place</kbd>. Every non-global piece of
data, and every segment of computation, exists in precisely one place, called
its <i>home</i>. (Every global piece of data exists conceptually in all
places. There are no global computations. A special class of data,
the <i>distributed array</i>, distributes non-global data across several
places, but we'll get to that later.) The set of places in your
program, <kbd>Place.places</kbd>, is chosen when you start your program, and
does not change.
</p>

<p>
The variable <kbd>here</kbd> is always bound to the current place -- that's
the place that the current line of code is executing at.
</p>

<p>
There's one other special place: <kbd>Place.FIRST_PLACE</kbd>.   This is the
place that <kbd>main</kbd> programs are started.  So, when you start off a
program, it will execute <kbd>main</kbd>, and <kbd>here</kbd> will be equal
to <kbd>Place.FIRST_PLACE</kbd>.  If you start computations at other
places, <kbd>here</kbd> will be set to other <kbd>Place</kbd> values for those
computations.  Each computation has its own <kbd>here</kbd> constant,
so <kbd>here</kbd> for <kbd>main</kbd> will always
be <kbd>Place.FIRST_PLACE</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
There might be other places around that you can use as well.  Typically, when
you write production code for a multicore machine, you'll want to have about
one place running on each core, so 
</p>

<a name="intro-bang"></a>
<p>
A value's home can be part of its type. The simplest way to say that an
object's home is <kbd>here</kbd> is to put a &ldquo;<kbd>!</kbd>&rdquo; after
its type. So, an object of type <kbd>Person</kbd> can be anywhere.  An object
of type <kbd>Person!</kbd> has to be located <kbd>here</kbd>.  
</p>

<p>
An object's home is the place that you create it.  So, <kbd>new Person()</kbd>
makes a new person located at <kbd>here</kbd>.  So, you'll often write: 
</p>

<!--
val p : Person! = new Person();

-->
<table class="ex">
<a name="src-new-Person-1"/>
<tr class="ex"><td><a href="#new-Person-1" class="ex">1</a></td><td class="ex"><code>val p : Person! = new Person();</code></td></tr>
</table>

<a name="new-Person-1"/>
<!--<p>  <a href="#src-new-Person-1">line 1: </a><kbd class="ex">val p : Person! = new Person();</kbd><br/></p>-->
<p>
(If you have another
place <kbd>there</kbd>, and you want to make a person over there, you'd use an
<a href="03-Tutorial.html#at-statement">X10 <kbd>at</kbd> statement</a> to run
a bit of code over <kbd>there</kbd>.  As a sneak preview, you'd
write <kbd>at(there) new Person()</kbd> to create a Person object
at <kbd>there</kbd>.)
</p>

<p>
One important feature -- the one that will annoy you the most when you start
using X10 -- is that you can only use non-global data effectively from the
place that it's defined.  Some methods and fields can be
marked <kbd>global</kbd>, and you can use them from anywhere.  Others will not
be marked <kbd>global</kbd>, and you have to use them from the object's home.  
</p>


<table border="1">


<tr>
  <td><b>Can Do From Anywhere</b></td>
  <td><b>Need To Be <kbd>here</kbd></b></td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>Refer to object</td>
  <td>Change object</td>
</tr>



<tr>
  <td>Call <kbd>global</kbd> method</td>
  <td>Call non-global method</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>Read <kbd>global</kbd> field</td>
  <td>Read / write non-global field</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Find <kbd>home</kbd> of object</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
(<b>Aside:</b> Sure, you <i>could</i> mark everything global, and lots of
programs would sort of work. However, global fields are expensive on
multiprocessors -- the system has to make sure that every processor which
needs their value has it. Also, global fields are <i>immutable</i>; you can't
change them. For best performance, you should make as few fields global as you
possibly can. Global <i>methods</i> are not particularly expensive, but are a
bit harder to code than non-global ones; you can make them global whenever you
feel like doing the extra work.)
</p>


<blockquote class="xiom">
<b>Xiom:</b> The global/non-global distinction in X10 is intended to make you
powerful, not miserable.  This will not be obvious while you are getting used
to X10.

<h4>Examples of Place Code</h4>

<p>
Here's how it's done right: 
</p>

<!--
public class GoodPlace {
  public static def main(argv:Rail[String]!) {
     val g : GoodPlace! = new GoodPlace();
     x10.io.Console.OUT.println(g.name());    
  }
  def name() = "Good Place";
}

<a name="src-goodplace-6"/>
<tr class="ex"><td><a href="#goodplace-6" class="ex">6</a></td><td class="ex"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;def name() = "Good Place";</code></td></tr>
<a name="src-goodplace-7"/>
<tr class="ex"><td><a href="#goodplace-7" class="ex">7</a></td><td class="ex"><code>}</code></td></tr>
</table>

<a name="goodplace-1"/>
<!--<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-1">line 1: </a><kbd class="ex">public class GoodPlace {</kbd><br/></p>-->
<a name="goodplace-2"/>
<!--<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-2">line 2: </a><kbd class="ex">  public static def main(argv:Rail[String]!) {</kbd><br/></p>-->
<a name="goodplace-3"/>
<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-3">line 3: </a><kbd class="ex">     val g :
    GoodPlace! = new GoodPlace();</kbd><br/>
Note that <kbd>!</kbd> in the type.  We're explicitly telling the compiler
    that <kbd>g</kbd> is located <kbd>here</kbd>.  <kbd>new GoodPlace()</kbd>
    creates a new <kbd>GoodPlace</kbd> object that's located <kbd>here</kbd>,
    so it all works out.
</p>
<a name="goodplace-4"/>
<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-4">line 4: </a><kbd class="ex">
    x10.io.Console.OUT.println(g.name());    </kbd><br/>
Now we call the <kbd>name</kbd> method on <kbd>g</kbd>.  <kbd>name</kbd> is
    non-global, but that's OK, because <kbd>g</kbd> is located <kbd>here</kbd>
    and that's where you're allowed to call non-global methods.
</p>
<a name="goodplace-5"/>
<!--<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-5">line 5: </a><kbd class="ex">  }</kbd><br/></p>-->
<a name="goodplace-6"/>
<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-6">line 6: </a><kbd class="ex">  def name() =
    "Good Place";</kbd><br/>
On this line is the definition of the <kbd>name</kbd> method.  It's non-global
    because there's no <kbd>global</kbd> modifier here.  In practice, a method
    that returns a constant string might as well be global.
</p>
<a name="goodplace-7"/>
<!--<p>  <a href="#src-goodplace-7">line 7: </a><kbd class="ex">}</kbd><br/></p>-->

<p>
And here's the same program done wrong: 
</p>

<!--

  public static def main(argv:Rail[String]!) {
    val b : BadPlace = new BadPlace();
    x10.io.Console.OUT.println(b.name()); // CAST OR ERROR

  def name() = "Bad Place";
}
-->

    is that <kbd>BadPlace</kbd> leaves off that all-important <kbd>!</kbd>.
This line does <i>not</i> get a compiler error, though.  It's perfectly fine
    to say that <kbd>b</kbd> refers to a <kbd>BadPlace</kbd> object that might
    be located <kbd>here</kbd> or might be located somewhere else.  You will
    often use <kbd>!</kbd>-less variable declarations -- they're exactly the
    right tool for talking about stuff that's located you-know-not-where or
    you-care-not-where, which you will do very often as you program X10.

<p>  <a href="#src-badplace-4">line 4: </a><kbd class="ex">

This line will get a compiler warning or error.  
(There are two compiler modes, one of which is fussier about this kind of
    error than the other.)
The problem is, we're only allowed to
    call a non-global method from the place that the object <kbd>b</kbd>
    lives, but we have told the compiler that we don't know where <kbd>b</kbd>
    lives.  Since we don't know that <kbd>b</kbd> lives <kbd>here</kbd>, we
    can't call <kbd>name</kbd> on it freely..

This attempts to subscript the rail <kbd>argv</kbd> by <kbd>0</kbd>, and store
    its value as <kbd>you</kbd>.  (Unlike Java and C++, square
    brackets <kbd>[]</kbd> are only used for type arguments and rail
    constructors in X10;
    subscripting uses parentheses <kbd>()</kbd>.)
    It's using <a href="#type-inference">type inference</a>, correctly, to
    avoid writing the type down.

<kbd>+</kbd> concatenates strings.  In fact, adding anything to a string will
convert the anything to a string and concatenate, much as in Java.

Compiling this, however, produces some error messages:</p>
<pre class="output">
/Users/bard/x10/src/x10/x10.tut/example/02/Hello2_Wrong.x10:4: Place type error: Method should be global. (Called within a global method.)    
     	 Method: apply
</pre>


<p>
This error message says that there's an error at line 4
of <kbd>Hello2_Wrong.x10</kbd>.  The line number (between the colons) is an
important clue.  
We're trying to evaluate <kbd>argv(0)</kbd>,
to get the first element of the <kbd>Rail[String]</kbd>
called <kbd>argv</kbd>. This is actually a method call to a method
called <kbd>apply</kbd>, even if it doesn't 
look like one, and a call of a non-global method at that.  
(Fortunately, almost all method calls look like method calls.  There are few
that have special syntax.  <i>Advantage: </i> You can define a method that
has function-call-like syntax.  <i>Disadvantage:</i> You have to be aware of
the true names of such methods.)
<a href="#location-location-location">As noted above,</a> you can't call
non-global methods unless the compiler can be sure that the object you're
calling the method on is located <kbd>here</kbd>, and <kbd>argv</kbd> is not.
</p>

<p>
The X10 compiler helpfully guesses what might have caused this particular
problem.  
</p>


<p>
All the compiler officially knows about <kbd>argv</kbd> is what we have told
it -- <i>viz.</i> that <kbd>argv</kbd> is a <kbd>Rail[String]</kbd>.  We
didn't tell it that <kbd>argv</kbd> was located <kbd>here</kbd>.   So, the
compiler doesn't know that.  
</p>

<p>
We must tell the compiler this important clue.
The <a href="#intro-bang">exclamation point
    syntax</a> <kbd>argv:Rail[String]!</kbd> is the simplest way to do so: that
says that <kbd>argv</kbd> is a <kbd>Rail[String]</kbd> and
located <kbd>here</kbd>.  
</p>




<p>
Adding this <kbd>!</kbd> to the code, we get:

follow the name of the main class on the command line.

<h2>Compiler Modes: normal and -STATIC_CALLS (v 2.0.3)</h2>

<p>
The X10 compiler, version 2.0.3, has a choice of modes for fussiness about the
places of calls. In the <b>strict</b> mode (with the compiler
flag <kbd>-STATIC_CALLS</kbd>), places are treated strictly.  Calls that the
compiler cannot confirm to be at the right place are simply not allowed.  
</p>

<p>
In the normal mode (no flag), calls that the compiler cannot
confirm <i>are</i> allowed.  However, since they are not semantically correct,
the compiler will sneakily insert runtime checks.  In normal mode, the
improper call 
to <kbd>b.name()</kbd> <a href="#src-badplace-4">above</a> is compiled much as
if it were <kbd>here != b.home ? signal_runtime_error() : b.name() </kbd>.
That is, it will signal an error if <kbd>b</kbd> turns out to be wrong
somehow.  
</p>

<p>
Since normal mode is less safe than strict, the compiler will warn you that
it's done something questionable.  It prints: 
</p>
<pre>
x10c: 1 dynamically checked calls or field accesses.
</pre>
<p>
to indicate that it had to insert one dynamic (<i>viz.</i> runtime) check.
You can see what checks it inserted with <kbd>-VERBOSE_CALLS</kbd>.  
</p>


<h3>Exercise: Optional Name</h3>

<p>
If you want to make sure you understand what's going on so far, try to
write <kbd>Hello3</kbd>, which prints <kbd>Hello, Kim</kbd> if you give
it <kbd>Kim</kbd> as a command-line argument, and <kbd>Hello, World</kbd> if
you don't give it command-line arguments.
</p>

<p>
You'll need one more thing: <kbd>argv.length</kbd> is the number of items
in <kbd>argv</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Actually, you'll need several more things. You might
want <kbd>if</kbd>, <kbd>==</kbd>, <kbd>{}</kbd>, or even <kbd>switch</kbd>
and <kbd>case</kbd> and <kbd>break</kbd> if you're feeling exotic.  They're
pretty much like Java and C++.  Try them and see.  
</p>

<p>
One solution is in <kbd>02/Hello3.x10</kbd>.
