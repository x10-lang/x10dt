<h1>X10 Project with C++ Back-End</h1>

<p>This section describes how to create an X10 project for generating C++ files as opposed to Java. 
<br>With this back-end, 
the generation of files, compilation and execution can be either be local or remote.</p>

<p>This section first describes how to create and validate a <i>local</i> X10 project with the C++ back-end. 
<br>See <a href="02newProjCppBackendRemote.html">X10 Remote Project with C++ Back-End</a> for the basics on setting up a remote project.

<a name="creation"></a>

<p>Once you have Eclipse and X10DT installed, you should be able to create X10 projects through the traditional project
creation wizard dialog: <span class="menu">File &gt; New &gt; Project...</span>
Then you should be able to select an X10 project with C++ back-end as shown below.</p>

<p class="note">Alternatively, if you have activated the X10 Perspective <span class="menu">Window &gt Open Perspective 
&gt X10</span>, you should be able to access the next menu items sequence 
<span class="menu">File &gt; New &gt; X10 Project (C++ back-end)</span>, or by doing a right-click in the Package Explorer 
view and selecting <span class="menu">New &gt; X10 Project (C++ back-end)</span>.</p>

The next dialog page will come up:

<p>Enter a project name and after that you should be able to click on <span class="menu">Finish</span>, 
or <span class="menu">Next</span> if you want further customizations. For instance, let's call the project <code>demo</code>.</p>

<p>At that point, an X10 project named <code>demo</code>, with C++ back-end  in <b>local mode</b>, with default 
communication interface and compilation commands, should be created. 
The project should now contain the files shown here: <font color="red">FIXME: need screenshot without platform.conf file</font>
</p>

<p class="note">You can check that the generation of C++ files occurred correctly by checking the content of the project 
output folder. One way to check that is to go to the Eclipse <b>Navigator</b> view, and click under the project folder.
In the case of the <code>demo</code> project, this should give the next list of files.

Note that a <b>refresh</b> on the output folder  directory (named 'bin' here) may be necessary.
To refresh a project or folder/directory, right-click and select 'Refresh'.
