 <h1>Running your X10 Application - C++ backend</h1>

<p>This section assumes you have already built your X10 Application with the C++ back-end.
See <a href="02newProjCppBackend.html">Creating an X10 project with the C++ back-end</a>
for more information on doing this.

</p>
<h3 id="launch">Launching</h3>
<a name="launching"></a>

Once a project has been successfully built, one can create a new launch configuration for
the X10 project with the C++ back-end.
<p>To access the launch configuration dialog, select Run > Run Configurations...</p>
<p>Then create a new launch configuration for "X10 Application (C++ back-end)" </p>

<p>The <i>Application</i> tab defines mostly the main class to execute within an X10 project with some specific arguments.
Select the project and the main class of the project to be executed.

</p>

<p>
<font color="red"> FIXME: update text and screenshots for communication interface</font>
The <i>Communication Interface</i> tab is initially empty, but once a project is selected, 
it should be filled in.  The form is populated  
according to the Communication Interface type (selected in the project platform configuration) in order to allow  
customizations.  Make any changes necessary (e.g. you probably want to increase the number of processes beyond 1.)

</p>

<p>When all the information is filled in and valid, the <i>Run</i> button in the lower right area of the launch dialog should become enabled.

</p>

<p>Clicking on the <i>Run</i> button will create the C++ executable for the X10 main class selected and will run it with the communication 
interface parameters defined. The output from the program will appear in the Console view.
