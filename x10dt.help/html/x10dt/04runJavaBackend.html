 <h1>Running your X10 Application - Java backend</h1>

<h2 id="running">Running - Java back-end</h2>
<p>
There are (at least) three ways to launch your X10 program within Eclipse.
Here they are in increasing complexity:
<ol>
<li> <b>Run directly from the 'Run' Button: </b>
To run your X10 program, the simplest way is to hit the green "Run" button (while the project or source file is selected).
It's the green circle in the toolbar with the white triangle inside it.
If you hover over this button, you'll see the words "Run Hello.x10" assuming that's the name of your program.
<br>If it only says "Run As..." then proceed to the second way, just below.</br>

</p>
<p>Hit the Run button to execute your program with all default settings for launching.
<br>The Console view shows the output (if any).

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><b>Run As...: </b>
<p>You can also use the context menu on the main source file or the project.
For example, right-mouse on the project name in the Package Explorer, and select Run As > X10 Application (Java back-end)

<br>The Console view shows the output (if any).

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Create a Run Configuration (also known as a 'Launch Configuration'): </b>
If you want to specify more options for running your program, or if the above doesn't work, you'll need to edit the Eclipse
<i>launch configuration</i>.
<p>Next to the run button, there is a downward-pointing arrow.  Select that and select 
"Run Configurations..."   
<br><img src="images/run-config.png">
Alternatively, you can select the Run menu, and under that, select
"Run Configurations..."
<br><img border="1"src="images/run-menu-config.png">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note: we describe the behavior of Eclipse 3.5.  Other versions of Eclipse, especially much earlier versions, may
label the menu items slightly differently.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Run Configurations dialog is shown.  
<br><img border="1" src="images/runConfigMain.png">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the "X10 Application (Java back-end") and double-click it, or select the 'new' icon, or 
use the context menu.  A new run/launch configuration is created, called "New_Configuration"
<br><img border="1" src="images/runConfigNew.png">
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The "Main" tab is selected when this dialog is shown.

If your project was selected before you opened this dialog, it is shown with your 
project selected.
If your Project isn't already selected, use the Browse button
to select the project, or enter it in the text field.  To select the Main class, use the Search button.
It should fill in the main class it found in your project.  ("Hello" in our case here.)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the "Arguments" tab to specify arguments to your program (if any).

<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Program arguments will be passed to the Main method, and VM arguments are used in the launching virtual machine.
If you specify at least one program argument here, the Hello World sample code will print it in the console when
you run.
VM arguments let you control other things:  for example, to launch with assertions turned on, add "-ea" to the VM arguments. 
<br>
<p>To start your X10 application, Select the "Run" button in the lower right corner of the launch
configuration dialog.

The program runs, and the output appears in the console view.
