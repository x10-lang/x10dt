<h1>Linux X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Linux, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.2.x or higher (for the X10 C++ backend)</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher (for the X10 Java backend)</li>
</ul>

<h4>gcc/g++</h4>
gcc is included with the os. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>
In my case, running Fedora 9, gcc version 4.3.0 is installed

<h4>java</h4>
Although Java is often times included with Linux, it usually is the OpenJDK runtime
environment. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
	whereis java
	java -version
</pre>
In the case of Fedora 9, java version 1.6.0 is installed.
However, it is recommended that you download and install the latest Sun JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
<pre>
	cd /usr
	mkdir java
	cd java
	cp ~/Download/jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin .
	chmod 777 jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	./jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	...license...
	yes
</pre>
Then you should modify your .bash_profile file to contain this directory in the PATH statement.
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>
Then modify your .bashrc file to define JAVA_HOME
<pre>
.bashrc
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11
export JAVA_HOME
</pre>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
You need to download the X10 2.1.2 distribution for your platform,
<pre>
AIX/Power
Linux/Power (SLES11)
Cygwin/x86
Linux/x86 (RHEL5)
Linux/x86_64 (RHEL5)
MacOS/x86 and x86_64
</pre>
in this case Linux/x86.
The Sockets runtime is inlcuded in the download.
Go to the <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.2+Release">X10 release 2.1.2 (http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.2+Release)</a> and download
the X10 distribution.  This will be usually stored in your "Downloads" directory depending on how
your browser is configured. You should modify Firefox on Linux to ask you where to download files.
You should check periodically for new releases at http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+Releases.
<p>
Next you need to install the X10 distribution so that it is available to use.  My recommendation is to
make a directory in the /usr/local or /opt tree. This procedure also allows easy updating to newer versions as they become 
available. Note that you may have to use the "sudo" command to get access. 

<pre>
	cd /usr
	mkdir local
	cd local
	mkdir x10
	cd x10
	mkdir 2.1.2
</pre>

Make all of these directories accessible by everyone
<pre>
	cd /usr
	chmod -R 755 local
</pre>

Now copy the x10 distribution that you downloaded to x10dist directory and unpack it.
<pre>
	cd /usr
	cd local
	cd x10
	cd 2.1.2
	cp ~/Downloads/x10-2.1.2_linux_x86.gz .
	gunzip x10-2.1.2_linux_x86.gz
	tar -xvf x10-2.1.2_linux_x86
</pre>

<p>
Now you are ready to setup your environment that makes use of this directory.
On Linux running the bash shell, it is probably better to modify .bash_profile to add the x10 bin directory
to your path.  You can also define aliases here, etc.  
<p>
Here is a sample .bash_profile
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11/bin:/usr/local/x10/2.1.2/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

Now you will be able to use the x10 commands to compile and run your programs.
My recommendation is to make an x10 directory or an x10work directory in your
home path, and create a directory for each project.
<p>
To get started we will copy the HelloWorld program from the x10 samples directory into your
working directory
<pre>
	cd ~
	mkdir x10
	cd x10
	mkdir HelloWorld
	cd HelloWorld
	cp /usr/local/x10/2.1.2/samples/HelloWorld.x10 .
</pre>
<h4>java backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the java backend you would enter
<pre>
	x10c HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
You should now see some java classes in your directory.
<pre>
HelloWorld$1.class		HelloWorld$Main.class	HelloWorld.x10
HelloWorld$Main$1.class	HelloWorld.class
HelloWorld$Main$2.class HelloWorld.java
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
	x10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
	Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>C++ backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the c++ backend you would enter
<pre>
	x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=Hello HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
The reason for using the -MAIN_CLASS is so that the compiler generates a
runtime called "Hello". If you leave off the -MAIN_CLASS directive, 
your output will be under a.out.
<p>
You should now see the following files in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld.cc	HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.h	HelloWorld.inc	HelloWorld.x10
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
	runx10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
	Hello World!
</pre>

Note that the C++ backend makes use of the OpenMPI runtime that is installed on your
system, so you can also enter the following command to run an x10 program
<pre>
	mpirun -np 1 HelloWorld
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may want to compile the other sample programs from the "samples"
directory.  Then you can begin creating your own programs.

<h4>Running x10 programs using <tt>Sockets</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
The sockets transport replaces <tt>pgas_sockets</tt> (which is closed-source, and requires some setup), and is currently the default backend if you don't compile with the "-x10rt" flag. You set an environment variable <tt>X10_NPLACES</tt> to specify the number of places. If this is not set, it defaults to 1 place on the local machine, and prints a warning. 
There are two ways to specify the machines to run on: 
<ul>
<li>Set the environment variable <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> to the full path for a hostfile. The hostfile is a simple text file that contains a list of hostnames to run on, with one line per machine. 
<li>Set the environment variable <tt>X10_HOSTLIST</tt>, to a comma-separated list of hostnames, without spaces. This environment variable is checked only if <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> was not set. 
</ul>
Both of the above will wrap if there are more places than hostnames specified. For example, setting <tt>X10_NPROCS=4</tt> and <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=host1,host2</tt> will cause places 0 and 2 to run on host1, and places 1 and 3 to run on host2. If neither of the above is set, and there is more than 1 place, then it defaults to running everything on localhost, and prints a warning. You can set <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=localhost</tt> to get the same effect without warning. 
If you're running on more than one machine, you should have public/private key ssh authentication set up, so you can ssh from one machine to another without getting a password prompt. You should also have your executable and hostfile available in the same location on every machine listed in the hostfile. You compile your program with "-x10rt sockets", and with ssh in place, and the environment variables set, you run your executable. You don't have to launch from one of the machines in the hostfile, but you do need to have the ssh authentication set up between the machine you launch from and the first machine in the list. 
<p>
The sockets backend supports gdb debugging through the <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG</tt> environment variable. The value of this has two forms: 
<ul>
<li>"place:port", where place is the place that you want to be debugged or the string "all", and port is the port number that you want gdbserver to use. This launches the runtime for the specified place under gdbserver, which allows you to connect to the remote runtime with your local gdb session. See <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_134.html">this link</a> for more details. If you specify "all" for the place, then all places will be started under gdbserver at the specified port. Be aware that if you have multiple places running on the same machine, then this will cause port number conflicts. 
<li>"place", where place is either the place that you want to be debugged, or the string "all". Setting this to a number causes the specified place to be launched under gdb in a new xterm. For example, setting <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG=0</tt> will cause the x10 runtime for place 0 to be started in a gdb session in a new xterm, while other places run normally. Setting this to "all" will cause all runtimes to execute in separate gdb xterms. Each xterm is given a title showing which place it is running so you can keep track. 
</ul>
If you are running on triloka, please be sure to ssh to each machine in your hostlist to ensure that GSA is mounted and you don't get a password prompt. More than once I've forgotten to do this, and the program appears to hang, when under the covers it's waiting at a password prompt. 
<p>
It's possible to run without the launcher, and start up each place manually. To do this, you need to set the X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME, X10_PLACE, and X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS environment variables, which would normally be set by the launcher. For example: 
<ul>

<li>// Launch three places on triloka1-3, all using port 7001: 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=0 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka1 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=1 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka2 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=2 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka3 
</ul>
Please note that currently, the Sockets backend will not work in an environment with mixed POWER and x86 hardware, due to different endianness. 
<p>

<h4>Running with <tt>Standalone</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
Standalone sets up shared memory regions and forks off one instance of the program per place. The places all run on the local machine. There is one environment variable "X10_NPLACES", which should be set to the number of places. If not set, it defaults to 1 and prints a warning. The standalone has transport has a limit on the size of the data blocks that can be sent (about 512k), because of the shared memory regions. To run, just compile with "-x10rt standalone", set the environment variable, and run your executable. This transport is a good choice if you're running everything one one machine and don't use large messages. 
<p>
Debugging under standalone is relatively easy, since all places are forked off from the main process, and gdb can be configured to follow these forks. 

<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.

<h4>Possible errors</h4>

If you see an error like this
<pre>
	0; xlupc transport: can't get network address associated with 	listner socket: Device not configured
	Abort trap
</pre>
This means that your ip address is being used by another program and the pgas library cannot
access the ip address using gethostbyname(). Check your /etc/hostconfig file does not contain
a HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts is configured properly

<h4>Make your own commands</h4>
You might want to make your own scripts or aliases so that you don't have to remember the exact
syntax. If you create scripts make sure that they are excutable.  If you place them in ~/bin
then you should add this to your PATH in your .bash_profile. You might also want to add
"./" to the beginning of your PATH statement so it will look first in the directory that you are in.
<h5>makejava shell script</h5>
<pre>
	x10c $1.x10
</pre>

<h5>runjava shell script</h5>
<pre>
	x10 $1
</pre>

<h5>makecpp shell script</h5>
<pre>
	x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=$1 $1.x10
</pre>

<h5>runcpp shell script</h5>
<pre>
	runx10 -MAIN_CLASS=$1 $1.x10
</pre>
or use the mpirun systax mentioned above
