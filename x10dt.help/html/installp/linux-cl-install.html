<h1>Linux X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Linux, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++</li>
	<li>java</li>
	<li>open MPI</li>
</ul>

<h4>gcc/g++</h4>
gcc is included with the os. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>
In my case, running Fedora 9, gcc version 4.3.0 is installed

<h4>java</h4>
Although Java is often times included with Linux, it usually is the OpenJDK runtime
environment. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
	whereis java
	java -version
</pre>
In the case of Fedora 9, java version 1.6.0 is installed.
However, it is recommended that you download and install the latest Sun JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
<pre>
	cd /usr
	mkdir java
	cd java
	cp ~/Download/jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin .
	chmod 777 jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	./jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	...license...
	yes
</pre>
Then you should modify your .bash_profile file to contain this directory in the PATH statement.
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>
Then modify your .bashrc file to define JAVA_HOME
<pre>
.bashrc
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11
export JAVA_HOME
</pre>

<h4>openmpi</h4>
OpenMPI is often not included with Linux. To check do the following
<pre>
	whereis mpirun
	mpirun -version
</pre>
In the case of Fedora 9, you should download version 1.3.x or later from the openmpi web site -
http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/
<p>
You should retrieve the openmpi-1.3.3.tar file or later version and unpack it.
<pre>
	tar -xvf openmpi-1.3.3.tar
</pre>
This will create an openmpi-1.3.3 directory.  Now you need to compile and
install openmpi using the following command sequence.
<pre>
	cd openmpi-1.3.3
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	
  ...lots of output...
	
	make all
	make install
</pre>
Note that the configure script supports a lot of different command line options. 
For example, the --prefix option in the above example tells Open MPI to install under the directory /usr/local/. 

</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
You need to download the X10 2.1 distribution for your platform,
<pre>
AIX/PowerPC 
Cygwin/x86 
Linux/x86 
Linux/x86_64 
MacOS/x86 
MacOS/x86_64 
</pre>
in this case Linux/x86.
The Common PGAS runtime is inlcuded in the download.
Go to the <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1+Release">X10 release 2.1 (http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1+Release)</a> and download
the X10 distribution.  This will be usually stored in your "Downloads" directory depending on how
your browser is configured. You should modify Firefox on Linux to ask you where to download files.
You should check periodically for new releases at http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+Releases.
<p>
Next you need to install the X10 distribution so that it is available to use.  My recommendation is to
make a directory in the /usr/local or /opt tree. This procedure also allows easy updating to newer versions as they become 
available. Note that you may have to use the "sudo" command to get access. 

<pre>
	cd /usr
	mkdir local
	cd local
	mkdir x10
	cd x10
	mkdir 2.1
</pre>

Make all of these directories accessible by everyone
<pre>
	cd /usr
	chmod -R 755 local
</pre>

Now copy the x10 distribution that you downloaded to x10dist directory and unpack it.
<pre>
	cd /usr
	cd local
	cd x10
	cd 2.1
	cp ~/Downloads/x10-2.1_linux_x86.tgz .
	gunzip x10-2.1_linux_x86.tgz
	tar -xvf x10-2.1_linux_x86.tar
</pre>

<p>
Now you are ready to setup your environment that makes use of this directory.
On Linux running the bash shell, it is probably better to modify .bash_profile to add the x10 bin directory
to your path.  You can also define aliases here, etc.  
<p>
Here is a sample .bash_profile
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11/bin:/usr/local/x10/2.1/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

Now you will be able to use the x10 commands to compile and run your programs.
My recommendation is to make an x10 directory or an x10work directory in your
home path, and create a directory for each project.
<p>
To get started we will copy the HelloWorld program from the x10 samples directory into your
working directory
<pre>
	cd ~
	mkdir x10
	cd x10
	mkdir HelloWorld
	cd HelloWorld
	cp /usr/local/x10/2.1/samples/HelloWorld.x10 .
</pre>
<h4>java backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the java backend you would enter
<pre>
	x10c HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
You should now see some java classes in your directory.
<pre>
HelloWorld$1.class		HelloWorld$Main.class	HelloWorld.x10
HelloWorld$Main$1.class	HelloWorld.class
HelloWorld$Main$2.class HelloWorld.java
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
	x10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
	Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>C++ backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the c++ backend you would enter
<pre>
	x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=Hello HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
The reason for using the -MAIN_CLASS is so that the compiler generates a
runtime called "Hello". If you leave off the -MAIN_CLASS directive, 
your output will be under a.out.
<p>
You should now see the following files in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld.cc	HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.h	HelloWorld.inc	HelloWorld.x10
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
	runx10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
	Hello World!
</pre>

Note that the C++ backend makes use of the OpenMPI runtime that is installed on your
system, so you can also enter the following command to run an x10 program
<pre>
	mpirun -np 1 HelloWorld
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may want to compile the other sample programs from the "samples"
directory.  Then you can begin creating your own programs.


<h4>Compiler options</h4>
Use "x10c -- -help" to get more detailed help on compiler options.
<pre>
$ x10c -- -help

                           Generate allocation of specialized Java array
                           classes (default = true)

<h4>Possible errors</h4>

If you see an error like this
<pre>
	0; xlupc transport: can't get network address associated with 	listner socket: Device not configured
	Abort trap
</pre>
This means that your ip address is being used by another program and the pgas library cannot
access the ip address using gethostbyname(). Check your /etc/hostconfig file does not contain
a HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts is configured properly

<h4>Make your own commands</h4>
You might want to make your own scripts or aliases so that you don't have to remember the exact
syntax. If you create scripts make sure that they are excutable.  If you place them in ~/bin
then you should add this to your PATH in your .bash_profile. You might also want to add
"./" to the beginning of your PATH statement so it will look first in the directory that you are in.
<h5>makejava shell script</h5>
<pre>

<h5>runjava shell script</h5>
<pre>
