<h1>Macintosh X10 Command Line Installation on Leopard</h1>
In order to run X10 on OS X Leopard, you need to satisfy the following pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.0.x or higher</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher</li>
	<li>Open MPI 1.2.x or higher</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, Mac OS X Leopard provides most of these as part of its environment. Although
you may have to download the development environment called Xcode to get the compiler tools.

<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is included with OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands

<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>

You should see something similar to this

<pre>
$ whereis gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
</pre>

<pre>
$ gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
Target i686-apple-darwin9
Configured with: ....
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
</pre>

If you do not get these results, you will have to install Apple's
Developer Tools called Xcode.  There are 2 ways to do this
<p>
1) There should be a version on your installation disk for Leopard.
You should insert your disk and go the the "Optional Installs" folder.
There you will see a "Xcode Tools" folder. When you select this folder,
you will see the "XcodeTools.mpkg" package installer. You should double
click on this and follow the instructions to install the Xcode tools.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.
<p> 
2) You can download Xcode from Apple's Developer Connection (ADC) site. 
<a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/303/wo/3K14hrg1ACiF2P18GAizqThJ6TZ/0.0">Developer Connection Member Site</a> 
This method insures that you will get the latest Xcode version whereas 
method 1 may be an earlier version available at the time of packaging the
Leopard installation DVD.
<P>
To access this site, you may have to signup for an ADC id. Once you are
logged into the member site, you should select the "Downloads" area
and then select "Developer Tools" on the right hand side from the Downloads area. 
You should scroll until you find "Xcode 3.1.4 Developer Tools"
which is the version for Leopard. You should note that "Xcode 3.2.1 Developer Tools"
is the version for Snow Leopard. 
<p>
Once you have downloaded the Xcode Disk Image, you can invoke the package installer.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.

<p>
Actually Xcode Tools comes with 2 versions of the gcc compiler, 
4.0 and 4.2.  Leopard defaults to 4.0.
If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can
see how the gcc and g++ commands are linked.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al g*
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
g++ -> g++-4.0
g++-4.0
g++-4.2
gatherheaderdoc
gcc -> gcc-4.0
gcc-4.0
gcc-4.2
gcov -> gcov-4.0
gcov-4.0
gcov-4.2
</pre>

If you want to switch to the 4.2 compiler, you just need to change the
links (g++, gcc, gcov, C++) to point to the 4.2 versions. You should also
change the links under Developer directory where Xcode was installed to be
consistent.
<p>
Also, Xcode 3.1.3 on Leopard points gcc and g++ by default at the 4.0 compiler 
(Xcode includes both 4.0 and 4.2), so you’ll have to change the links:

<pre>
  % su -
  $ cd /usr/bin
  $ rm gcc cc g++ c++ gcov
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 gcc
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 cc
  $ ln -s g++-4.2 g++
  $ ln -s c++-4.2 c++
  $ ln -s gcov-4.2 gcov
  $
</pre>
<p>
There’s an identical set of links in /Developer/usr/bin that you should probably 
also change (for safety and consistency’s sake).

<p>
You will need to do this in order to build the x10 distribution which
will be discussed in another chapter.

<h4>java</h4>
Java is also included with the OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands
<pre>
whereis java
java -version</li>
</pre>

You should see something like this

<pre>
$ whereis java
/usr/bin/java
</pre>

<pre>
$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_20"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_20-b02-315)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_20-141, mixed mode, sharing)
</pre>

If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can see that the java command
is a link.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al java
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
</pre>

Actually OS X ships with multiple versions of java
under
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions
If you are up to date with patches, you will also find java 1.6 here.
If you want to switch to java 1.6, you can change the links to "Current" and
"CurrentJDK" in the JavaVM.framworks versions directory.  See chapter XX.

<h4>Open MPI</h4>
OpenMPI is also included with OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands
<pre>
whereis mpirun
mpirun -version</li>
</pre>

You should see something similar to this

<pre>
$ whereis mpirun
/usr/bin/mpirun
</pre>

<pre>
$ mpirun -version
mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.3
</pre>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

You need to download the X10 2.1 distribution for your platform,
<pre>
AIX/PowerPC 
Cygwin/x86 
Linux/x86 
Linux/x86_64 
MacOS/x86 
MacOS/x86_64 
</pre>
in this case MacOS/x86. The Common PGAS runtime is included with the X10 platform.
Go to the <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.0+Release">X10 release 2.1 (http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.0+Release)</a> 
and download the X10 distribution.  This will be usually stored in your "Downloads" directory depending on how
your browser is configured. You should check periodically for new releases at http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+Releases.
<p>
Next you need to install the X10 distribution so that it is available to use.  
You should make a directory in the /usr/local or /opt directory for this version.  This procedure
will allow easy updating to a newer version when it becomes available. 
Note that you may have to use the "sudo" command to get access. 

<pre>
cd /usr
mkdir local
cd local
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir 
cd 2.1
</pre>

Make the directory accessible by everyone
<pre>
cd /usr
chmod -R 755 local
</pre>

Now copy the x10 download to x10dist directory 
and unpack it.
<pre>
cd /usr
cd local
cd x10
cd 2.1
cp /Users/cals/Downloads/x10-2.1.0_macos_x86.tar .
tar -xvf x10-2.1.0_macos_x86.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Now you are ready to setup your environment that makes use of this directory.
On the Mac it is probably better to create a .bash_profile to add the x10 bin directory
to your path.  You can also define aliases here, etc.  
<p>
Here is a sample .bash_profile that adds the X10 bin directory to your path.
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/x10/2.1/bin
export PATH
</pre>

Now you will be able to use the x10 commands to compile and run your programs.
You should make an x10 or an x10work directory in your
home path, and create a subdirectory for each project.

<p>
To get started you should copy the HelloWorld program from the x10 samples directory into your
working directory. For example,
<pre>
cd ~
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
cp /usr/local/x10/2.1/samples/HelloWorld.x10 .
</pre>

<h4>Using the java backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the java backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>

You should now see some java classes in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld$1.class		HelloWorld$Main.class	HelloWorld.x10
HelloWorld$Main$1.class	HelloWorld.class
HelloWorld$Main$2.class HelloWorld.java
		
</pre>

You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
x10 HelloWorld
</pre>

You should see the program output
<pre>
Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>Using the C++ backend</h4>
To compile this program with the c++ backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=Hello HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
The reason for using the -MAIN_CLASS is so that the compiler generates a
runtime called "Hello". If you leave off the -MAIN_CLASS directive, 
your output will be under a.out.
<p>
You should now see the following files in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld.cc	HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.h	HelloWorld.inc	HelloWorld.x10
</pre>

You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
runx10 HelloWorld
</pre>

You should see the program output
<pre>
Hello, x10 World!
The answer is: true
</pre>

Note that the C++ backend makes use of the OpenMPI runtime that is installed on your
system, so you can also enter the following command to run an x10 program
<pre>
mpirun -np 1 HelloWorld
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may want to compile the other sample programs from the "samples"
directory.  Then you can begin creating your own programs.

<h4>Running x10 programs in more than 1 place</h4>
<ul>
<li>
To run the compiled X10 executable in one place, invoke
<pre>
    bin/runx10 ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<li>
To run in multiple places on Linux, run "bin/manager", and then invoke 
<pre>
    bin/launcher -t &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The basic idea is the following.
<ol>
<li>Make a hostlist.txt containing A and B on separate lines
	<ul>
	<li> A
	<li> B
	</ul>
<li>In one window/console/xterm run the command manager hostlist.txt
<li>In a different window/console do: launcher -t 2 HelloWholeWorld
</ol>
<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.
<p>
When you do (3) you should see some output in the manager window
telling you that jobs are starting stopping.
</p>
<li>
To run in multiple places on AIX, run
<pre>
  "LAPI_USE_SHMEM=yes poe ./&lt;class_name&gt; -procs &lt;nplaces&gt; -hostfile HOSTFILE".
</pre>
  See "man poe" for additional options and the format of HOSTFILE.
<br><br>
<li>
If you have mpi available, you can use mpirun to run in multiple places.
  Details will vary depending on the exact syntax of the mpirun command,
  but something like this should work:
<pre>  
  mpirun -hostfile &lt;hosts&gt; -n &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
</ul>

<h4>Compiler options</h4>
Use "x10c -- -help" to get more detailed help on compiler options.
<pre>
$ x10c -- -help
usage: x10c [options] <source-file>.x10 ...

<h4>Possible errors</h4>
<p>
If you see an error like this
<pre>
0; xlupc transport: can't get network address associated with 	listner socket: Device not configured
Abort trap
</pre>
This means that your ip address is being used by another program and the pgas library cannot
access the ip address using gethostbyname(). Check your /etc/hostconfig file does not contain
a HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts is configured properly

<P>
To speed up C++ compilation, use the -commandlineonly flag to make the compiler
only generate C++ code for the exact files specified on the command line.
</p>

<h4>Make your own commands</h4>
You might want to make your own scripts or aliases so that you don't have to remember the exact
syntax for java and C++. If you create scripts make sure that they are excutable.  
If you place them in ~/bin then you should add this to your PATH in your .bash_profile.
For example
<h5>makejava shell script</h5>
<pre>
makejava
	x10c $1.x10
</pre>

<h5>runjava shell script</h5>
<pre>
runjava
	x10 $1
</pre>

<h5>makecpp shell script</h5>
<pre>
makecpp
	x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=$1 $1.x10
</pre>

<h5>runcpp shell script</h5>
<pre>
runcpp
	runx10 -MAIN_CLASS=$1 $1.x10
</pre>
or use the mpirun systax mentioned above
