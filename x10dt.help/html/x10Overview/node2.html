Introduction
</H1>
The vast and omni-present computer industry of today is based
fundamentally on what we shall call the <EM>standard</EM> model of
computing.
This is organized around the idea that a single stream of instructions
operates on  <EM>memory</EM> - discrete cells holding <EM>values</EM>  -
by <EM>reading</EM>  these values, operating on them to produce new
values, and <EM>writing</EM> these values back into memory.

<P>
In the last few years this model has been changed fundamentally, and
forever. We have entered the era of <EM>concurrency</EM> and <EM>  distribution</EM>. 

<P>
Moore's Law continues, unabated - making available twice the number
of transistors every 18 months for the same silicon. Traditionally,
computer  architects have used this extra real estate to provide
faster implementations of the standard model by increasing clock speed
and  deepening the pipelines needed to speculatively execute many
instructions in parallel. Thus, the standard model has needed no
change. 

<P>
Unfortunately, clock speeds have now run up against the <EM>heat
  envelope</EM> - speed cannot be increased without causing the chips to
run hotter  than can be tolerated by current packaging. 

<P>
What should this real estate be used for, then? Computer manufacturers
have turned to multi-core parallelism, a radical idea for mainstream
computing. Instead of
using all the real estate to support the illusion of a single thread
of execution, they have divided up the real estate to support 
multiple such threads of control. Multiple threads may now read and
write the same locations simultaneously.  

<P>
This change has been coupled with a second, less visible but equally
powerful change. The widespread availability of cheap commodity
processors  and advances in computer networking mean that <EM>  clusters</EM> of multiple computers are now commonplace. Further, a
vast increase in the amount of data available for processing means
that there is real economic value in using clusters to analyze this data, and
act on it. 

<P>
Consequently, the standard model must now give way to a new programming
model. This model must support execution of programs on thousands of
multi-core computers, with tens of thousands of threads, operating on
petabytes of data. The model should smoothly extend the original
standard model so that familiar ideas, patterns, idioms continue to
work, in so far as possible. It should permit easy problems to be
solved easily, and must allow sophisticated programmers to solve hard
problems.  It should permit programmers to make reasonably accurate
performance predictions by just looking at the code. It should be
practical and easily implementable on all existing computer systems.

<P>
Since 2004, we have been developing just such a new programming
model. We began our work as part of the DARPA-IBM funded PERCS
research project. The project set out to develop a petaflop computer
(capable of <IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$10^{15}$"> operations per second), which could be programmed
ten times more  productively than computer of similar scale in 2002.
Our specific charter was to develop a programming model for such large
scale, concurrent systems that could be used to program a wide variety
of computational problems, and could be accessible to a large class of
professional programmers.  

<P>
The programming model we have been developing is called the <EM>  APGAS</EM> model, the <EM>Asynchronous, Partitioned Global Address
  Space</EM> model. It extends the standard model with two core
concepts: <EM>places</EM> and <EM>asynchrony</EM>. The collection of cells
making up memory are thought of as partitioned into chunks called
places, each with one or more simultaneously operating threads of
control. A  cell in one place can refer to a cell in another - i.e.
the cells make up a (partitioned) global address space. Four new basic
operations are provided.  An <TT>async</TT> spawns a new thread of
control that operates asynchronously with other threads.  An async may
use an <TT>atomic</TT> 
operation to
execute a set of operations on cells located in the current place, as
if in a single step.
It may
use the <TT>at</TT> operation to switch the place of execution. Finally,
and most importantly it may use the <TT>finish</TT> operation to execute
a sequence of statements and wait for all asyncs spawned (recursively)
during their execution to terminate.  These operations 
are orthogonal and
can nest
arbitrarily with few exceptions.
The power of the APGAS model lies in that many patterns of
concurrency, communication and control - including those expressible
in other parallel models of computation such as PThreads, OpenMP, MPI,
Cilk - can be effectively realized through appropriate combinations
of these constructs. Thus APGAS is our proposed replacement for the
standard model. 

<P>
Any language implementing the old standard model can be extended to
support the APGAS model by supplying constructs to implement these
operations. This has been done for Java<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>(X10&nbsp;1.5), 
C (Habanero C), and
research efforts are underway to do this for 
UPC. 

<P>
Our group has designed and implemented a new programming language, X10 ,
organized around these ideas. X10  is a modern language in the strongly
typed, object-oriented programming tradition. Its design draws on the
experience of team members with foundational models of concurrency,
programming language design and semantics, type systems, static
analysis, compilers, runtime systems, virtual machines. Our goals
were simple - design a language that fundamentally focuses on
concurrency and distribution, and is capable of running with good
performance at scale, while building on the established
productivity of object-oriented languages. In this, we sought to span
two distinct programming language traditions - the old tradition of
statically linked, ahead-of-time compiled languages such as Fortran,
C, C++, and the more modern dynamically linked, VM based languages
such as Java, C#, F#. X10  supports both compilation to the JVM and,
separately, compilation to native code. It runs on the PERCS machine
(Power 7 CPUs, P7IH interconnect), on Blue Gene machines, on clusters
of commodity nodes, on laptops; on AIX, Linux, MacOS; on PAMI, and MPI;
on Ethernet and Infiniband.
