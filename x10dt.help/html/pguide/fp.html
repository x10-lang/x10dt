This is a draft of the Part I of the Guide. This draft focusses on core features of the 
X10 language and programming model.  This Guide is a work-in-progress.  We anticipate that
a complete draft of Part I and a substantial part of Part II will be available
in early first quarter 2011.

<h1>Preface</h1>

<h2>Who This Book Is For</h2>
The X10 programming language was introduced to try to bring to programming
in the  high-performance world the latest in programming language technology. 
This text is an attempt to start programmers who have some experience with an 
object-oriented language on the road to writing X10.  We'll talk about Java
and C++ from time to time, since they seem to be the most broadly taught for the
likely audience for this book, but we'll do so only to help translate from these
languages into X10, not to explain X10 itself. So, even
familiarity with "scripting" languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or
Smalltalk will give you the background we need, although you may find that the
X10 syntax takes some getting used to if come from as far away as Python or
Smalltalk.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Those familiar with C, but not C++, may find this book useful,
but some minimal knowledge of object-oriented programming really is a must-
classes, objects, class methods versus instance methods, and so on, but nothing deep. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<h2>The Scope Of The Book</h2>
Just as programmers using the MPI library can go a long way with only a
half-dozen or so  of the more than one hundred entries in that library, 
the new X10 programmer can get a lot of mileage out of a carefully
chosen subset of  X10  constructs.  Our aim here is to get you started, so
we stick to what we need to do that 80 or 90<br />going to have to face. The final chapter surveys what we don't cover here 
in detail.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here is a quick outline of what we are going to do.

<blockquote>
The first chapter is a
sampling of a  few simple X10 programs so you can get a feeling for the
language.   It introduces concurrency, both local and distributed.  The
emphasis  here is on the basic constructs, not on performance, except to the
extent that  it comes up as a reason for choosing one construct over another.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The next several chapters flesh out the critical parts of the language:
types, expressions, control flow, and so on.

<h2>Getting X10 Onto Your Machine</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've put together some installation guides for various platforms that show in
detail how to set up your workstation to develop X10 programs. The
platforms supported are

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b>Mac:</b></dt>
	<dd><a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/mac-cl-install.html">http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/mac-cl-install.html</a></dd>
 <dt><b>Linux:</b></dt>
	<dd><a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/linux-cl-install.html">http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/linux-cl-install.html</a></dd>
 <dt><b>Windows:</b></dt>
	<dd><a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/windows-cl-install.html">http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/windows-cl-install.html</a></dd>
</dl>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once you have the environment set up, you will be able to run the programs in
this guide.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For Windows users, we have also developed a batch installation of the Cygwin
environment that X10requires.  This will make it easier to get started than
getting what you need piecemeal off the Web. The installer can be downloaded
from

<blockquote>
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip">http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip</a>
</blockquote>
You can refer to the Windows installation guide above for more details about its
use.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you are an Eclipse user, the X10 Development Toolkit (X10DT) is a
plugin that can be installed
into Eclipse 3.5.x (Galileo) or Eclipse 3.6.x (Helios).  If you are unfamiliar
with Eclipse, it is a free Open Source IDE, and we recommend you take a look at
its introductory Web page, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php">http://www.eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php</a>.  
If you have Eclipse installed, you can go to the 
<tt>Help</tt> menu and select "<tt>Install New Software</tt>".  You will be asked
to add an update site.  The url to use for X10DT is:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.1/updateSite/">http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.1/updateSite/</a>.
</blockquote>
If you want to install both Eclipse and X10DT together from scratch, there is
an all-in-one installation that contains everything you need to start
building X10 programs.  It can be downloaded from the X10 web site:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10DT+2.1+Installation">http://x10.codehaus.org/X10DT+2.1+Installation</a>.
</blockquote>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The X10 web site, <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/">http://x10.codehaus.org/</a>, is a source for the latest news about
X10. 
The X10 mailing lists are all hosted at <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/For+Users">http://x10.codehaus.org/For+Users</a>. 
You can subscribe to any of them, but the ones most likely 
to be of interest are

<ul>
<li> x10-announce: for (infrequent) announcements of X10 releases, and
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> x10-users: for a general X10 user list.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
Particular thanks go to David Grove and Igor Peshansky, who have gone out of their
way to answer our questions and to lay out the rationale behind X10's design.  Rachel
Bellamy, Vijay Saraswat, Mandana Vaziri, and Yoav Zibin were kind enough to read a very early
version carefully, and this draft is much the better for their comments.
