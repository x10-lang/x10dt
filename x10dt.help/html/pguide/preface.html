<h1>Preface</h1>
The X10 programming language was introduced to try to bring to programming in the high-performance world
the latest in programming language technology.  This text is an attempt to start programmers who have seen
some Java and/or C++ on the road to writing X10.  Those familiar with C, but not C++, may find this book useful,
but some minimal knowledge of object-oriented program in the Java/C++ style
( classes, objects, static methods in classes) really is a must. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another large HPC community is the 
FORTRAN community.  FORTRAN is sufficiently different from Java and C/C++, and our own
personal experience with
FORTRAN is so limited, that we do not feel confident we can speak well to that audience, so if FORTRAN
is your thing, by all means take a look here, but if you find it tough slogging, the problem is likely what our
exposition assumes, not anything deeply mysterious about X10.
We hope to find someone who can remedy this situation ASAP.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just as programmers using the MPI library can go a very long way with only a half-dozen or so of the
more than one hundred entries in that library, 
the new X10 programmer can get a lot of mileage out of a carefully
chosen subset of the constructs X10  provides.  Our aim here is to get you started, not finish you off, so we
stick to what we need to do that 80 or 90<br />The final chapter surveys what we don't cover here in detail.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here is a quick outline of what we are going to do.  The first chapter is a sampling of a few simple X10
programs so you can get a feeling for the language.  Already it introduces concurrency, both local and
distributed.  The next several chapters flesh out the critical parts of the language: classes, expressions,
control flow, .  That rounds out the first part of the text.  In the second part, "Advanced Topics," 
we have drawn on some examples elaborated by
Michael J. Quinn in his text "<em>Parallel Programming in C with MPI
and OpenMP</em>", published by McGraw-Hill in 2004.  Here we try to give more substantial examples
so that you can get a feeling for how X10 plays in industrial-strength applications.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Quinn's book
provides a  very readable basic introduction to parallel computing.
Although we try to be reasonably self-contained, we rely on Quinn's text for the discussion
of the language-independent analysis of the problems. We have also tried to make each program
self-contained, with a <tt>main()</tt>  that
does something useful.  Also, we have occasionally gone a little beyond what is 
in Quinn's examples, mostly in order to show how the serial side of X10 might be
used to organize the melange of trivia that seems necessary to implement any real
application.  Quinn, writing in C, had the luxury of 30 or so years of examples
out there and no need to embroider the parallel code that was his real focus.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We highly recommend having Quinn's book close at hand when working through these
advanced examples.  Quinn's treatment of the MPI and OpenMP
approaches to these problems will be very helpful, particularly if you have not
had a lot of experience with this sort of programming.  
X10, with the advantage of many years of hindsight into the good and bad
of parallel language design, sometimes has more
graceful ways of saying what needs to be said, but a lot of insight went into the
design of MPI and OpenMP.  Becoming fluent in them is not only its own reward, but
it will help in understanding where X10 is coming from.
