<h2>Who This Book Is For</h2>
The X10 programming language was introduced to try to bring to programming in the high-performance world
the latest in programming language technology.  This text is an attempt to start programmers who have 
some experience with an object-oriented language on the road to writing X10.  We'll talk about Java and
C++  from time to time, since they seem to be the most broadly taught for the likely audience for this book,
but only to help translate from these languages into X10, not to explain X10itself.
So, even "scripting" languages like
JavaScript, Ruby, or Python should give one enough intuition.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Those familiar with C, but not C++, may find this book useful,
but some minimal knowledge of object-oriented programming really is a must-
classes, objects, class methods versus instance methods, and so on, but nothing deep. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<h2>The Scope Of The Book</h2>
Just as programmers using the MPI library can go a long way with only a half-dozen or so of the
more than one hundred entries in that library, 
the new X10 programmer can get a lot of mileage out of a carefully
chosen subset of  X10  constructs.  Our aim here is to get you started, not finish you off, so we
stick to what we need to do that 80 or 90<br />The final chapter surveys what we don't cover here in detail.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here is a quick outline of what we are going to do.  The first chapter is a sampling of a few simple X10
programs so you can get a feeling for the language.  Already it introduces concurrency, both local and
distributed.  The emphasis here is on the basic constructs, not on performance, except to the extent
that it comes up as a reason for choosing one construct over another.  The next several chapters flesh out the critical parts of the language: classes, expressions,
control flow, .  That rounds out the first part of the text.  In the second part, "Advanced Topics," 
we have drawn on some examples elaborated by
Michael J. Quinn in his text "<em>Parallel Programming in C with MPI
and OpenMP</em>", published by McGraw-Hill in 2004.  Here we try to give more substantial examples
so that you can get a feeling for how X10 plays in industrial-strength applications, and
performance is a critical part of the discussion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Quinn's book
provides a  very readable basic introduction to parallel computing.
Although we try to be reasonably self-contained, we rely on Quinn's text for the discussion
of the language-independent analysis of the problems. We have also tried to make each program
self-contained, with a <tt>main()</tt>  that
does something useful.  We tend to go a little beyond what is 
in Quinn's examples, mostly in order to show how the serial side of X10 might be
used to organize the melange of trivia that seems necessary to implement any real
application.  Quinn, writing in C, had the luxury of 30 or so years of examples
out there and hence no need to embroider the parallel code that was his real focus.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We highly recommend having Quinn's book close at hand when working through these
advanced examples.  Quinn's treatment of the MPI and OpenMP
approaches to these problems will be very helpful, particularly if you have not
had a lot of experience with this sort of programming.  
X10, with the advantage of many years of hindsight into the good and bad
of parallel language design, sometimes has more
graceful ways of saying what needs to be said, but a lot of insight went into the
design of MPI and OpenMP.  Becoming fluent in them is not only its own reward, but
it will help in understanding where X10 is coming from.

<h2>Getting X10 Onto Your Machine</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've put together some installation guides for various platforms detailing on how to 
set up your workstation to develop X10 programs. The platforms supported are

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once you have your environment set up you will be able to run the programs in this guide, as well as 
developing your own programs.
