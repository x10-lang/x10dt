X10 objects are a powerful general-purpose programming tool. However, the
power must be paid for in space and time. In space, a typical object
implementation requires some extra memory for run-time class information, as
well as a pointer for each reference to the object.  In time, a typical object
requires an extra indirection to read or write data, and some computation to
figure out which method body to call.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For high-performance computing, this overhead may not be acceptable for all
objects. X10 provides structs, which are stripped-down objects. They are less
powerful than objects; in particular they lack inheritance and mutable fields.
Without inheritance, method calls do not need to do any lookup; they can be
implemented directly. Accordingly, structs can be implemented and used more
cheaply than objects, potentially avoiding the space and time overhead.
(Currently, the C++ back end avoids the overhead, but the Java back end
implements structs as Java objects and does not avoid it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Structs and classes are interoperable. Both can implement interfaces (in
particular, like all X10 values they implement <b>Any</b>), and subprocedures
whose arguments are defined by interfaces can take both structs and classes.
(Some caution is necessary here: referring to a struct through an interface
requires overhead similar to that required for an object.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In many cases structs can be converted to classes or classes to structs,
within the constraints of structs. If you start off defining a struct and
decide you need a class instead, the code change required is simply changing
the keyword <b>struct</b> to <b>class</b>. If you have a class that does not use
inheritance or mutable fields, it can be converted to a struct by changing its
keyword. Client code using the struct that was a class will need certain
changes: <em>e.g.</em>, the <b>new</b> keyword must be added in constructor calls, and
structs (unlike classes) do not have default values.
