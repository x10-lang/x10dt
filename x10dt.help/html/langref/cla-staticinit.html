<a name="StaticInitialization">

The X10 runtime implements the following procedure to ensure
reliable initialization of the static state of classes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Execution commences with a single thread executing the
<em>initialization</em> phase of an X10 computation at place <b>0</b>. This
phase must complete successfully before the body of the <b>main</b> method is
executed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The initialization phase must be thought of as if it is implemented in
the following fashion: (The implementation may do something more
efficient as long as it is faithful to this semantics.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
Within the scope of a new finish
for every static field f of every class C 
   (with type T and initializer e):
async {
  val l = e; 
  ateach (Dist.makeUnique()) {
     assign l to the static f field of 
         the local C class object;
     mark the f field of the local C 
         class object as initialized;
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
During this phase, any read of a static field <b>C.f</b> (where <b>f</b> is of type <b>T</b>)
is replaced by a call to the method <b>C.read_f():T</b> defined on class <b>C</b>
as follows

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
def read_f():T {
   when (initialized(C.f)){};
   return C.f;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If all these activities terminate normally, all static fields have values of
their declared types, 
and the <b>finish</b> terminates normally. If
any activity throws an exception, the <b>finish</b> throws an
exception. Since no user code is executing which can catch exceptions
thrown by the finish, such exceptions are printed on the console, and
computation aborts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the activities deadlock, the implementation deadlocks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In all cases, the main method is executed only once all static fields
have been initialized correctly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since static state is immutable and is replicated to all places via 
the initialization phase as described above, it can be accessed from
any place.
