<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10's <b>atomic</b> blocks provide a high-level construct for coordinating
the mutation of shared data. 
A programmer may use atomic blocks to guarantee that invariants of
shared data-structures are maintained even as they are being accessed
simultaneously by multiple activities running in the same place.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, consider a class <b>Redund[T]</b>, which encapsulates a list
<b>list</b> and, (redundantly) keeps the size of the list in a second field
<b>size</b>.  Then <b>r:Redund[T]</b> has the invariant 
<b>r.list.size() == r.size</b>, which must be true at any point at which
no method calls on <b>r</b> are active.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the <b>add</b> method on <b>Redund</b> (which adds an element to the list) 
were defined as: 
<pre>
def add(x:T) { // Incorrect
  this.list.add(x);
  this.size = this.size + 1;
}
</pre>
Then two activities simultaneously adding elements to the same <b>r</b> could break the
invariant.  Suppose that <b>r</b> starts out empty.  Let the first activity
perform the <b>list.add</b>, and compute <b>this.size+1</b>, which is 1, but not store it
back into <b>this.size</b> yet.  
(At this point, <b>r.list.size()==1</b> and <b>r.size==0</b>; the invariant
expression is false, but, as the first call to <b>r.add()</b> is active, the
invariant does not need to be true - it only needs to be true when the
call finishes.)
Now, let the second activity do its call to
<b>add</b> to completion, which finishes with <b>r.size==1</b>.  
(As before, the invariant expression is false, but a call to <b>r.add()</b> is
still active, so the invariant need not be true.)
Finally, let
the first activity finish, which assigns the <b>1</b> computed before back into
<b>this.size</b>.  At the end, there are two elements in <b>r.list</b>, but
<b>r.size==1</b>. Since there are no calls to <b>r.add()</b> active, the
invariant must be true, but it is not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In this case, the invariant can be maintained by making the increment atomic.
Doing so forbids that sequence of events; the <b>atomic</b> block cannot be
stopped partway.  
<pre>
def add(x:T) { 
  this.list.add(x);
  atomic { this.size = this.size + 1; }
}
</pre>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc7.1">
7.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconditional atomic blocks</h3>
The simplest form of an atomic block is the <em>unconditional
atomic block</em>: <b>atomic S</b>.
It is executed by an activity as if in a single step
during which all other concurrent activities in the same place are
blocked. If execution of the statement may throw an exception, it is
the programmer's responsibility to wrap the atomic block within a
<b>try</b>/<b>finally</b> clause and include undo code in the finally
clause. Thus the <b>atomic</b> statement only guarantees atomicity on
successful execution, not on a faulty execution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atomic blocks are closely related to non-blocking synchronization
constructs [], and can be used to implement 
non-blocking concurrent algorithms.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Code executed inside of <b>atomic S</b> and <b>when S</b> is subject
to certain restrictions. A violation of these restrictions causes an 
<b>IllegalOperationException</b> to be thrown at the point of the violation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul>
<li> <b>S</b> may not spawn another activity.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> <b>S</b> may not use any blocking statements; <b>when</b>, <b>next</b>,
      <b>finish</b>.  (The use of a nested <b>atomic</b> is permitted.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> <b>S</b> may not <b>force()</b> a <b>Future</b>.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> <b>S</b> may not use <b>at</b> expressions.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Note an important property of an (unconditional) atomic block:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr><td width="50%"></td><td nowrap="nowrap" align="right" colspan="1"><table><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="right" colspan="1"> <b><b>atomic</b> {<b>s</b><b>1</b><b>;</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>s</b><b>2</b>}</b> = <b><b>atomic</b> {<b>s</b><b>1</b><b>;</b> <b>s</b><b>2</b>}</b></td></tr></table></td><td width="50%"></td><td width="1" align="right">(1)</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atomic blocks do not introduce deadlocks.    They may exhibit all the bad
behavior of sequential programs, including throwing exceptions and running
forever, but they are guaranteed not to deadlock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc7.1.1">
7.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following class method implements a (generic) compare and swap (CAS) operation:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
var target:Object = null;
public atomic def CAS(old1: Object, new1: Object): Boolean {
   if (target.equals(old1)) {
     target = new1;
     return true;
   }
   return false;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc7.2">
7.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional atomic blocks</h3>



<div class="p"><!----></div>
Conditional atomic blocks allow the activity to wait for some condition to be
satisfied before executing an atomic block. For example, consider a
<b>Redund</b> class holding a list <b>r.list</b> and, redundantly, its length
<b>r.size</b>.  A <b>pop</b> operation will delay until the <b>Redund</b> is
nonempty, and then remove an element and update the length.  
<pre>
def pop():T {
  var ret : T;
  when(size&#62;0) {
    ret = list.removeAt(0);
    size -;
    }
  return ret;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The execution of the test is atomic with the execution of the block.  This is
important; it means that no other activity can sneak in and make the condition
be false before the block is executed.  In this example, two <b>pop</b>s
executing on a list with one element would work properly. Without the
conditional atomic block - even doing the decrement atomically - one call to
<b>pop</b> could pass the <b>size&#62;0</b> guard; then the other call could run to
completion (removing the only element of the list); then, when the first call
proceeds, its <b>removeAt</b> will fail.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that <b>if</b> would not work here.  
<b>if(size&#62;0) atomic{size--; return list.removeAt(0);}</b> allows another
activity to act between the test and the atomic block.  
And 
<b>atomic{ if(size&#62;0) {size--; ret = list.removeAt(0);}}</b> 
does not wait for <b>size&#62;0</b> to become true.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Conditional atomic blocks are of the form <b>when(b)S</b>; 
<b>b</b> is called the <em>guard</em>, and <b>S</b> the <em>body</em>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity executing such a statement suspends until such time as the  guard
is true in the current state. In that state, the 
body is executed. 
The checking of the guards and the execution of the corresponding
guarded statement is done atomically. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 does not guarantee that a conditional atomic block
will execute if its condition holds only intermittently. For, based on
the vagaries of the scheduler, the precise instant at which a
condition holds may be missed. Therefore the programmer is advised to
ensure that conditions being tested by conditional atomic blocks are
eventually stable, , they will continue to hold until the block
executes (the action in the body of the block may cause the condition
to not hold any more).

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The statement <b>when (true) S</b> is
behaviorally identical to <b>atomic S</b>: it never suspends.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The body <b>S</b> of <b>when(b)S</b> is subject to the same restrictions that
the body of <b>await S</b> is.  The guard is subject to the same restrictions
as well.  Furthermore, guards should not have side effects.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that this implies that guarded statements are required to be <em>
flat</em>, that is, they may not contain conditional atomic blocks. (The
implementation of nested conditional atomic blocks may require
sophisticated operational techniques such as rollbacks.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following class shows how to implement a bounded buffer of size
1 in X10 for repeated communication between a sender and a
receiver.  The call <b>buf.send(ob)</b> waits until the buffer has space, and
then puts <b>ob</b> into it.  Dually, <b>buf.receive()</b> waits until the
buffer has something in it, and then returns that thing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
class OneBuffer[T] {
  var datum: T;
  def this(t:T) { this.datum = t; this.filled = true; }
  var filled: Boolean;
  public def send(v: T) {
    when (!filled) {
      this.datum = v;
      this.filled = true;
    }
  }
  public def receive(): T {
    when (filled) {
      v: T = datum;
      filled = false;
      return v;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
