 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clock operations</h2><a name="sec:clock">
</a>
There are two language constructs for working with clocks. 
<b>async clocked(cl) S</b> starts a new activity registered on one or more
clocks.  <b>next;</b> blocks the current activity until all the activities
sharing clocks with it are ready to proceed to the next clock phase. 
Clocks are objects, and have a number of useful methods on them as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating new clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:create">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clocks are created using a factory method on <b>x10.lang.Clock</b>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
val c: Clock = Clock.make();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The current activity is automatically registered with the newly
created clock.  It may deregister using the <b>drop</b> method on
clocks (see the documentation of <b>x10.lang.Clock</b>). All activities
are automatically deregistered from all clocks they are registered
with on termination (normal or abrupt).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Registering new activities on clocks</h3>
<a name="sec:clock:register">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The statement 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
  async clocked (c1, c2, c3) S
</pre>
starts a new activity, initially registered with
clocks <b>c1</b>, <b>c2</b>, and <b>c3</b>, and  running <b>S</b>. The activity running this code must
be registered on those clocks. 
Violations of these conditions are punished by the throwing of a
<b>ClockUseException</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If an activity &#945; that has executed <b>c.resume()</b> then starts a
new activity &#946; also registered on <b>c</b> (, via <b>async
clocked(c) S</b>), the new activity &#946; starts out having also resumed
<b>c</b>, as if it too had executed <b>c.resume()</b>.  
<pre>
//alpha
val c = Clock.make();
c.resume();
async clocked(c) {
  // beta;
  c.next();
  beta_phase_two();
}
c.next();
alpha_phase_two();
</pre>
In the proper execution, &#945; and &#946; both perform
<b>c.next()</b> and then their phase-2 actions.  
However, if &#946; were not
initially in the resume state for <b>c</b>, there would be a race condition;
&#946; could perform <b>c.next()</b> and proceed to <b>beta_phase_two</b>
before &#945; performed <b>c.next()</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may check that it is registered on a clock <b>c</b> by
the predicate <b>c.registered()</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Note:
X10 does not contain a "register" operation that would allow an activity
to discover a clock in a datastructure and register itself on it. Therefore,
while a clock <b>c</b> may be stored in a data structure by one activity
<b>a</b> and read from it by another activity <b>b</b>, <b>b</b> cannot do much
with <b>c</b> unless it is already registered with it.  In particular, it
cannot register itself on <b>c</b>, and, lacking that registration, cannot
register a sub-activity on it with <b>async clocked(c) S</b>.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming clocks</h3><a name="resume">
</a><a name="sec:clock:resume">
</a>
X10 permits <em>split phase</em> clocks. An activity may wish
to indicate that it has completed whatever work it wishes to perform
in the current phase of a  clock <b>c</b> it is registered with, without
suspending altogether. It may do so  by executing 
<b>c.resume()</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may invoke <b>resume()</b> only on a clock it is registered with,
and has not yet dropped (&#167;). A
<b>ClockUseException</b> is thrown if this
condition is violated. Nothing happens if the activity has already invoked a
<b>resume</b> on this clock in the current phase.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancing clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:next">
</a>
An activity may execute the statement
<pre>
next;
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Execution of this statement blocks until all the clocks that the
activity is registered with (if any) have advanced. (The activity
implicitly issues a <b>resume</b> on all clocks it is registered
with before suspending.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>next;</b> may be thought of as calling <b>c.next()</b> in parallel for all
clocks that the current activity is registered with.  (The parallelism is
conceptually important: if activities &#945; and &#946; are both
registered on clocks <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>, and &#945; executes
<b>c.wait(); d.wait()</b> while &#946; executes <b>d.wait(); c.wait()</b>,
then the two will deadlock.  However, if the two clocks are waited on in
parallel, as <b>next;</b> does, &#945; and &#946; will not deadlock.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Equivalently, <b>next;</b> sequentially calls <b>c.resume()</b> for each
registered clock <b>c</b>, in arbitrary order, and then <b>c.wait()</b> for each
clock, again in arbitrary order.  Implementations are more likely to use this 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity blocked on <b>next</b> resumes execution once
it is marked for progress by all the clocks it is registered with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.5">
1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:drop">
</a>
An activity may drop a clock by executing <b>c.drop()</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The activity is no longer considered registered with this
clock.  A <b>ClockUseException</b> is thrown if the activity has
already dropped <b>c</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
