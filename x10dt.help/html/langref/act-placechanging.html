2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>at</tt>: Place Changing</h2><a name="AtStatement">
</a>



<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may change place synchronously using the <b>at</b> statement or
<b>at</b> expression. This is an expensive operation and must be used
with care.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>  
<table>
<tr><td align="right">AtStatement    ::= at PlaceExpSingleList Statement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">
 AtExp    ::= at PlaceExpSingleList ClosureBody </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">
</td></tr></table>
</em>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <em>PlaceExp</em> must be an expression of type <b>Place</b> or some subtype.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity executing statement <b>at (q) S</b> at a place <b>p</b>
evaluates <b>q</b> at <b>p</b> and then moves to <b>q</b> to execute
<b>S</b> as follows. Note that the value obtained by evaluating <b>q</b>
is not necessarily distinct from <b>p</b> (e.g. <b>q</b> may be
<b>here</b>).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, the runtime identifies the object graph at <b>p</b> reachable
from lexically scoped initialized variables (say, <b>v1</b>,...,
<b>vn</b>) referenced in <b>S</b>.  Second this graph is <em>
  serialized</em> into a buffer and transmitted to place <b>q</b>.  Third,
the variables <b>v1</b>,..., <b>vn</b> are re-created at <b>q</b> and
initialized with the objects obtained by deserializing the buffer at
<b>q</b>. Fourth, <b>S</b> is executed at <b>q</b> (in an environment in
which the variable <b>vi</b> refers to the re-created variable at
<b>q</b>).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On normal termination of <b>S</b> control returns to <b>p</b> and
execution is continued with the statement following <b>at (q) S</b>. If
<b>S</b> terminates abruptly with exception <b>E</b>, <b>E</b> is
serialized into a buffer, the buffer is communicated to <b>p</b> where
it is deserialized into an exception <b>E1</b> and <b>at (e) S</b>
throws <b>E1</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since <b>at(e) S</b> is a synchronous construct, usual control-flow
constructs such as <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, <b>return</b> and 
<b>throw</b> are permitted in <b>S</b>.  All concurrency related
constructs - <b>async</b>, <b>finish</b>, <b>atomic</b>, <b>when</b> are
also permitted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>Limitation</em> In <b>at(e) S</b>, <b>S</b> is permitted to access only
those immutable variables in the surrounding scope that are definitely
initialized.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that since values accessed across an <b>at</b> boundary are
copied, the programmer may wish to adopt the discipline that either
variables accessed across an <b>at</b> boundary  contain only structs 
or stateless objects, or the methods invoked on them do not access any
mutable state on the objects. Otherwise the programmer has to ensure
that side effects are made to the correct copy of the object. For this
the struct <b>x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]</b> is often useful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Serialization and deserialization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>


The X10 runtime provides a default mechanism for
serializing/deserializing an object graph with a given set of roots.
This mechanism may be overridden by the programmer on a per class or
struct basiss as described in <b>x10.io.CustomSerialization</b>. 
The default mechanism performs a
deep copy of the object graph (that is, it copies the object or struct
and, recursively, the values contained in its fields), but does not
traverse <b>transient</b> fields. Instead on serialization the default
value &#167; for the type of the field is used.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A struct <b>s</b> of type <b>x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]</b> 
is serialized as a unique global reference to its contained object
<b>o</b> (of type <b>T</b>).  Please see the documentation
of <b>x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]</b> for more details.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</h3>
<b>at(p)S</b> does <em>not</em> start a new activity.  It should be thought of as
transporting the current activity to <b>p</b>, running <b>S</b> there, and then
transporting it back.  <b>async</b> is the only construct in the
language that starts a new activity. In different contexts, each one
of the following makes sense:
(1) <b>async at(p) S</b> (spawn an activity locally to execute <b>S</b> at
<b>p</b>; here <b>p</b> is evaluated by the spawned activity) , 
(2) <b>at(p) async S</b> (evaluate <b>p</b> and then at <b>p</b> spawn an
activity to execute <b>S</b>), and,
(3) <b>async at(p) async S</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since <b>at(p) S</b> does not start a new activity, 
<b>S</b> may contain constructs which only make sense
within a single activity.  
For example, 
<pre>
    for(x in globalRefsToThings) 
      if (at(x.home) x().nice()) 
        return x();
</pre>
returns the first nice thing in a collection.   If we had used 
<b>async at(x.home)</b>, this would not be allowed; 
you can't <b>return</b> from an
<b>async</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit copying from <tt>at</tt> </h3>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>at(p)S</b> copies nearly all data that <b>S</b> might reference, and sends it
to place <b>p</b>, before executing <b>S</b> there. The only things that are not
copied are values only reachable through <b>GlobalRef</b>s and <b>transient</b>
fields.    If <b>x</b> is a
variable name referring to some object <b>ob</b> outside of <b>S</b>, then the
same variable name <b>x</b> refers to a deep copy of <b>ob</b>
inside of <b>S</b>.  In this way the body <b>S</b> is in a separate block with
different variable bindings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, consider the following program.
<pre>
val c = new Cell[Int](9); // (1)
at (here) {               // (2)
   assert(c() == 9);      // (3)
   c.set(8);              // (4)
   assert(c() == 8);      // (5)
}
assert(c() == 9);         // (6)
</pre>
The <b>at</b> statement implicitly copies the <b>Cell</b> and its contents.  
After <b>(1)</b>, <b>c</b> is a <b>Cell</b> containing 9; call that cell c<sub>1</sub>
At <b>(2)</b>, that cell is copied, resulting in another cell c<sub>2</sub> whose
contents are also 9, as tested at <b>(3)</b>.
(Note that the copying behavior of <b>at</b> happens <em>even when the
destination place is the same as the starting place</em>- even with
<b>at(here)</b>.)
At <b>(4)</b>, the contents of c<sub>2</sub> are changed to 8, as confirmed at <b>(5)</b>; the contents of
c<sub>1</sub> are of course untouched.    Finally, at <b>(c)</b>, outside the scope
of the <b>at</b> started at line <b>(2)</b>, <b>c</b> refers to its original
value c<sub>1</sub> rather than the copy c<sub>2</sub>.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <b>at</b> statement induces a <em>deep copy</em>.  Not only does it copy the
values of variables, it copies values that they refer to through zero or more
levels of reference.  Structures are preserved as well: if two fields
<b>x.f</b> and <b>x.g</b> refer to the same object o<sub>1</sub> in the original, then
<b>x.f</b> and <b>x.g</b> will both refer to the same object o<sub>2</sub> in the
copy.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, in the following variation of the preceding example,
<b>a</b>'s original value a<sub>1</sub> is an array with two references to the same
<b>Cell[Int]</b> c<sub>1</sub>.  The fact that a<sub>1</sub>(0) and a<sub>1</sub>(1) are both
identical to c<sub>1</sub> is demonstrated in <b>(A)</b>-<b>(C)</b>, as a<sub>1</sub>(0) is modified
and a<sub>1</sub>(1) is observed to change.  In <b>(D)</b>-<b>(F)</b>, the copy
a<sub>2</sub> is tested in the same way, showing that a<sub>2</sub>(0) and a<sub>2</sub>(1) both
refer to the same <b>Cell[Int]</b> c<sub>2</sub>.  However, the test at <b>(G)</b>
shows that c<sub>2</sub> is a different cell from c<sub>1</sub>, because changes to
c<sub>2</sub> did not propagate to c<sub>1</sub>.  
<pre>
val c = new Cell[Int](5);
val a = new Array[Cell[Int]][c,c];
assert(a(0)() == 5 &amp;&amp; a(1)() == 5);     // (A)
c.set(6);                               // (B)
assert(a(0)() == 6 &amp;&amp; a(1)() == 6);     // (C)
at(here) {
  assert(a(0)() == 6 &amp;&amp; a(1)() == 6);   // (D)
  c.set(7);                             // (E)
  assert(a(0)() == 7 &amp;&amp; a(1)() == 7);   // (F)
}
assert(a(0)() == 6 &amp;&amp; a(1)() == 6);     // (G)
</pre>

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.1">
2.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copying and Transient Fields</h4>




<div class="p"><!----></div>
Recall that fields of classes and structs marked <b>transient</b> are not copied by
<b>at</b>.  Instead, they are set to the default values for their types. Types
that do not have default values cannot be used in <b>transient</b> fields.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the following example, every <b>Trans</b> object has an <b>a</b>-field equal
to 1.  However, despite the initializer on the <b>b</b> field, it is not the
case that every <b>Trans</b> has <b>b==2</b>.  Since <b>b</b> is <b>transient</b>,
when the <b>Trans</b> value <b>this</b> is copied at <b>at(here){...}</b> in
<b>example()</b>, its <b>b</b> field is not copied, and the default value for an
<b>Int</b>, 0, is used instead.  
Note that we could not make a transient field <b>c : Intc != 0</b>, since the
type has no default value, and copying would in fact set it to zero.
<pre>
class Trans {
   val a : Int = 1;
   transient val b : Int = 2;
   //ERROR transient val c : Int{c != 0} = 3;
   def example() {
     assert(a == 1 &amp;&amp; b == 2);
     at(here) {
        assert(a == 1 &amp;&amp; b == 0);
     }
   }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.2">
2.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copying and GlobalRef</h4>
<a name="GlobalRef">
</a>



<div class="p"><!----></div>
A <b>GlobalRef[T]</b> (say <b>g</b>) contains a reference to
a value of type <b>T</b>, in a form which can be transmitted, and a <b>Place</b>
<b>g.home</b> indicating where the value lives. When a 
<b>GlobalRef</b> is serialized an opaque, globally uniqe handle to
the enclosed value <b>o</b> is passed. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following example does not copy the value <b>huge</b>.  However, <b>huge</b>
would have been copied if it had been put into a <b>Cell</b>, or simply used
directly. 
<pre>
val huge = &#196; potentially big thing";
val href = GlobalRef(huge);
at (here) {
   use(href);
  }
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Values protected in <b>GlobalRef</b>s can be retrieved by the <b>g.apply()</b>
method, often abbreviated simply <b>g()</b>.  <b>g.apply()</b> is guarded; it can
only be called when <b>g.home == here</b>.  If you  want to do anything other
than pass a global reference around or compare two of them for equality, you
need to placeshift back to the home place of the reference, often with
<b>at(g.home)</b>.   For example, the following  program modifies the
command-line argument array.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
  public static def main(argv: Array[String](1)) {
    val argref = GlobalRef[Array[String](1)](argv);
    at(here.next()) use(argref);
  }
  static def use(argref : GlobalRef[Array[String](1)]) {
    at(argref.home) {
      val argv = argref();
      argv(0) = "Hi!";
    }
  }
</pre>

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.3">
2.2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Warnings about <b>at</b></h4>
There are two dangers involved with <b>at</b>: 

<ul>
<li> Careless use of <b>at</b> can result in copying and transmission
of very large data structures.  In particular, it is very easy to capture
<b>this</b> - a field reference will do it - and accidentally copy everything
that <b>this</b> refers to, which can be very large.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> As seen in the examples above, a local variable reference
  <b>x</b> may refer to different objects in different nested <b>at</b>
  scopes The programmer must either ensure that a variable accessed
  across an <b>at</b> boundary has no mutable state or be prepared to
  reason about which copy gets modified.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.4">
2.2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>at</tt> and Variables</h4>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>var</b> variables can be set at the place that they are declared, but not
from other places.  This allows a straightforward way to transmit several
pieces of information back from an <b>at(somewhereElse)</b>, as shown by the
following example which computes the roots of the quadratic equation 
ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0.  
For the sake of the example, we assume that 
<tt>mathProcessor()</tt> returns a Place suitable for calculation.  In practice
it would rarely if ever make sense to send such a small calculation to another
place. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The starting place has local <b>var</b>s <b>r</b> and <b>s</b>, which will hold
the roots. 
The computation at the math processor evaluates the roots of the equation.
These roots are bound to math processor local <b>val</b> variables <b>rr</b> and
<b>ss</b>.  An inner place-shifting <b>at(h)</b> moves the computation back to
the initial place, stored for that purpose in <b>h</b>, at which values can be
assigned to the variables <b>r</b> 
and <b>s</b> at the starting place.  Note that we take care to send only the
minimal information across <b>at</b> boundaries; in particular we do not 
send the discriminant back to <b>h</b>.  When the intermediate results are
large and the desired data small, the savings can be substantial.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
def printRootsOfQuadratic(a:Complex, b:Complex, c:Complex) {
  var r : Complex = Complex(0,0);
  var s : Complex = Complex(0,0);
  val h = here;
  at(mathProcessor()) {
    val disc = Math.sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c);
    val rr = (-b + disc) / (2*a);
    val ss = (-b - disc) / (2*a);
    at(h) {
      r = rr; s = ss;
    }
  }
  Console.OUT.println("r = " + r + "; s = " + s);
}
