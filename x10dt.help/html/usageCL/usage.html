This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0.

This is a distribution of the X10 Programming Language.
http://x10-lang.org/

To complete the installation, the scripts in bin/ may need to be made
executable.

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the
directory where you find bin/java.

Java backend instructions
-------------------------
To compile an X10 source program using the Java backend, invoke
"bin/x10c <class_name>.x10".
See "bin/x10c --help" for command-line help.

To run the compiled X10 class, invoke "bin/x10 <class_name>".
See "bin/x10 --help" for command-line help.

C++ backend instructions
------------------------
To compile an X10 source program using the C++ backend, invoke
"bin/x10c++ -o <class_name> <class_name>.x10".  This will
produce an executable named "<class_name>" in the current
directory[*].

To run the compiled X10 executable in one place, invoke
"bin/runx10 ./<class_name>".
- To run in multiple places on Linux, run "bin/manager", and then
  invoke "bin/launcher -t <nplaces> ./<class_name>".
- If you have mpi available, you can use mpirun to run in multiple places.
  Details will vary depending on the exact syntax of the mpirun command,
  but something like: "mpirun -hostfile <hosts> -n <nplaces> ./<class_name>"
  should work
