<div class="p"><!----></div>
Asynchronous activities serve as a single abstraction for supporting a
wide range of concurrency constructs such as message passing, threads,
DMA, streaming, data prefetching. (In general, asynchronous operations
are better suited for supporting scalability than synchronous
operations.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity is created by executing the statement:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  :  |        <em>  
<table>
<tr><td align="right">Statement &nbsp;AsyncStatement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">AsyncStatement &nbsp;"async" PlaceExpressionSingleList<sup>?</sup>&nbsp;Statement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">PlaceExpressionSingleList &nbsp;"(" PlaceExpression ")" </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">PlaceExpression &nbsp;Expression 
</td></tr></table>
</em> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The place expression "e" is expected to be of type "Place",
e.g., "here" or "d(p)" for some
distribution "d" and point "p" (&#167;).  
If not, the compiler replaces
"e" with "e.home" if
"e" is of type "x10.lang.Object". Otherwise the compiler reports a type error. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note specifically that the expression "a(i)" when used as a place
expression may evaluate to "a(i).home", which may not be
the same place as "a.dist(i)". The programmer must be 
careful to choose the right expression, appropriate for the statement.
Accesses to "a(i)" within <em>Statement</em> should typically be guarded 
by the place expression "a.dist(i)".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In many cases the compiler may infer the unique place at which the
statement is to be executed by an analysis of the types of the
variables occurring in the statement. (The place must be such that the
statement can be executed safely, without generating a
"BadPlaceException".) In such cases the programmer may omit the
place designator; the compiler will throw an error if it cannot
determine the unique designated place.<a href="#tthFtNtAAD" name="tthFrefAAD"><sup>3</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity A executes the statement "async (P) S" by launching
a new activity B at the designated place, to execute the specified
statement. The statement terminates locally as soon as B is
launched.  The activation path for B is that of A, augmented with
information about the line number at which B was spawned.  B
terminates normally when S terminates normally.  It terminates
abruptly if S throws an (uncaught) exception. The exception is
propagated to A if A is a root activity (see &#167;),
otherwise through A to A's root activity. Note that while an
activity is running, exceptions thrown by activities it has already
generated may propagate through it up to its root activity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Multiple activities launched by a single activity at another place are
not ordered in any way. They are added to the pool of activities at
the target place and will be executed in sequence or in parallel based
on the local scheduler's decisions. If the programmer wishes to
sequence their execution s/he must use X10 constructs, such as
clocks and "finish" to obtain the desired effect.  Further, the
X10 implementations are not required to have fair schedulers,
though every implementation should make a best faith effort to ensure
that every activity eventually gets a chance to make forward progress.

The statement in the body of an "async" is subject to the
restriction that it must be acceptable as the body of a "void"
method for an anonymous inner class declared at that point in the code,
which throws no checked exceptions. As such, it may reference
variables in lexically enclosing scopes (including "clock"
variables, &#167;) provided that such variables are
(implicitly or explicitly) "val".
