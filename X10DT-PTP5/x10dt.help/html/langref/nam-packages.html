1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Packages</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A package is a named collection of top-level type declarations, <em>viz</em>, class,
interface, and struct declarations. Package names are sequences of
identifiers, like <b>x10.lang</b> and <b>com.ibm.museum</b>. The multiple names
are simply a convenience, though there is a tenuous relationship between
packages <b>a</b>, <b>a.b</b>, and <b>a.c</b>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Packages and protection modifiers determine which top-level names can be used
where. Only the <b>public</b> members of package <b>pack.age</b> can be accessed
outside of <b>pack.age</b> itself.  
<pre>
package pack.age;
class Deal {
  public def make() {}
}
public class Stimulus {
  private def taxCut() = true;
  protected def benefits() = true;
  public def jobCreation() = true;
  /*package*/ def jumpstart() = true;
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The class <b>Stimulus</b> can be referred to from anywhere outside of
<b>pack.age</b> by its full name of <b>pack.age.Stimulus</b>, or can be imported
and referred to simply as <b>Stimulus</b>.  The public <b>jobCreation()</b>
method of a <b>Stimulus</b> can be referred to from anywhere as well; the other
methods have smaller visibility.  The non-<b>public</b> class <b>Deal</b> cannot
be used from outside of <b>pack.age</b>.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Name Collisions</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is a static error for a package to have two members with the same name. For
example, package <b>pack.age</b> cannot define two classes both named
<b>Crash</b>, nor a class and an interface with that name.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Furthermore, <b>pack.age</b> cannot define a member <b>Crash</b> if there is
another package named <b>pack.age.Crash</b>, nor vice-versa. (This prohibition
is the only actual relationship between the two packages.)  This prevents the
ambiguity of whether <b>pack.age.Crash</b> refers to the class or the package.  
Note that the naming convention that package names are lower-case and package
members are capitalized prevents such collisions.
