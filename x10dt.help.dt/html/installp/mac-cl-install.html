<h1>Macintosh X10 Command Line Installation on Leopard</h1>
In order to run X10 on OS X Leopard, you need to satisfy the following pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.2.x or higher (for the X10 C++ backend)</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher (for the X10 Java backend)</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, Mac OS X Leopard provides most of these as part of its environment. Although
you may have to download the development environment called Xcode to get the compiler tools.

<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is included with OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands

<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>

You should see something similar to this

<pre>
$ whereis gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
</pre>

<pre>
$ gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
Target i686-apple-darwin9
Configured with: ....
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
</pre>

If you do not get these results, you will have to install Apple's
Developer Tools called Xcode.  There are 2 ways to do this
<p>
1) There should be a version on your installation disk for Leopard.
You should insert your disk and go the the "Optional Installs" folder.
There you will see a "Xcode Tools" folder. When you select this folder,
you will see the "XcodeTools.mpkg" package installer. You should double
click on this and follow the instructions to install the Xcode tools.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.
<p> 
2) You can download Xcode from  
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple's Developer Connection (ADC) site</a>.
This method insures that you will get the latest Xcode version whereas 
method 1 may be an earlier version available at the time of packaging the
Leopard installation DVD.
<P>
To access this site, you may have to signup for an ADC id. 
You should select the "Resources" link near the top and
then select "Developer Downloads" under the Mac OS X section. 
Then you select "Developer Tools" under the "Downloads" section on the right. 
You should scroll until you find "Xcode 3.1.4 Developer Tools"
which is the version for Leopard. You should note that "Xcode 3.2.1 Developer Tools"
is the version for Snow Leopard. 
<p>
Once you have downloaded the Xcode Disk Image, you can invoke the package installer.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.

<p>
Actually Xcode Tools comes with 2 versions of the gcc compiler, 
4.0 and 4.2.  Leopard defaults to 4.0.
If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can
see how the gcc and g++ commands are linked.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al g*
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
g++ -> g++-4.0
g++-4.0
g++-4.2
gatherheaderdoc
gcc -> gcc-4.0
gcc-4.0
gcc-4.2
gcov -> gcov-4.0
gcov-4.0
gcov-4.2
</pre>

If you want to switch to the 4.2 compiler, you just need to change the
links (g++, gcc, gcov, C++) to point to the 4.2 versions. You should also
change the links under Developer directory where Xcode was installed to be
consistent.
<p>
Also, Xcode 3.1.3 on Leopard points gcc and g++ by default at the 4.0 compiler 
(Xcode includes both 4.0 and 4.2), so you’ll have to change the links:

<pre>
  % su -
  $ cd /usr/bin
  $ rm gcc cc g++ c++ gcov
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 gcc
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 cc
  $ ln -s g++-4.2 g++
  $ ln -s c++-4.2 c++
  $ ln -s gcov-4.2 gcov
  $
</pre>
<p>
There’s an identical set of links in /Developer/usr/bin that you should probably 
also change (for safety and consistency’s sake).

<p>
You will need to do this in order to build the x10 distribution which
will be discussed in another chapter.

<h4>java</h4>
Java is also included with the OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands
<pre>
whereis java
java -version</li>
</pre>

You should see something like this

<pre>
$ whereis java
/usr/bin/java
</pre>

<pre>
$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_20"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_20-b02-315)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_20-141, mixed mode, sharing)
</pre>

If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can see that the java command
is a link.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al java
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
</pre>

Actually OS X ships with multiple versions of java
under
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions
If you are up to date with patches, you will also find java 1.6 here.
If you want to switch to java 1.6, you can change the links to "Current" and
"CurrentJDK" in the JavaVM.framworks versions directory.

<h4>Running x10 programs using <tt>Sockets</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
The sockets transport replaces <tt>pgas_sockets</tt> (which is closed-source, and requires some setup), and is currently the default backend if you don't compile with the "-x10rt" flag. You set an environment variable <tt>X10_NPLACES</tt> to specify the number of places. If this is not set, it defaults to 1 place on the local machine, and prints a warning. 
There are two ways to specify the machines to run on: 
<ul>
<li>Set the run configuration variable <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> to the full path for a hostfile. The hostfile is a simple text file that contains a list of hostnames to run on, with one line per machine. 
<li>Set the run configuration variable <tt>X10_HOSTLIST</tt>, to a comma-separated list of hostnames, without spaces. This run configuration variable is checked only if <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> was not set. 
</ul>
Both of the above will wrap if there are more places than hostnames specified. For example, setting <tt>X10_NPROCS=4</tt> and <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=host1,host2</tt> will cause places 0 and 2 to run on host1, and places 1 and 3 to run on host2. If neither of the above is set, and there is more than 1 place, then it defaults to running everything on localhost, and prints a warning. You can set <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=localhost</tt> to get the same effect without warning. 
If you're running on more than one machine, you should have public/private key ssh authentication set up, so you can ssh from one machine to another without getting a password prompt. You should also have your executable and hostfile available in the same location on every machine listed in the hostfile. You compile your program with "-x10rt sockets", and with ssh in place, and the run configuration variables set, you run your executable. You don't have to launch from one of the machines in the hostfile, but you do need to have the ssh authentication set up between the machine you launch from and the first machine in the list. 
<p>
The sockets backend supports gdb debugging through the <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG</tt> run configuration variable. The value of this has two forms: 
<ul>
<li>"place:port", where place is the place that you want to be debugged or the string "all", and port is the port number that you want gdbserver to use. This launches the runtime for the specified place under gdbserver, which allows you to connect to the remote runtime with your local gdb session. See <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_134.html">this link</a> for more details. If you specify "all" for the place, then all places will be started under gdbserver at the specified port. Be aware that if you have multiple places running on the same machine, then this will cause port number conflicts. 
<li>"place", where place is either the place that you want to be debugged, or the string "all". Setting this to a number causes the specified place to be launched under gdb in a new xterm. For example, setting <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG=0</tt> will cause the x10 runtime for place 0 to be started in a gdb session in a new xterm, while other places run normally. Setting this to "all" will cause all runtimes to execute in separate gdb xterms. Each xterm is given a title showing which place it is running so you can keep track. 
</ul>
If you are running on triloka, please be sure to ssh to each machine in your hostlist to ensure that GSA is mounted and you don't get a password prompt. More than once I've forgotten to do this, and the program appears to hang, when under the covers it's waiting at a password prompt. 
<p>
It's possible to run without the launcher, and start up each place manually. To do this, you need to set the X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME, X10_PLACE, and X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS run configuration variables, which would normally be set by the launcher. For example: 
<ul>

<li>// Launch three places on triloka1-3, all using port 7001: 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=0 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka1 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=1 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka2 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=2 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka3 
</ul>
Please note that currently, the Sockets backend will not work in an environment with mixed POWER and x86 hardware, due to different endianness. 
<p>

<h4>Running with <tt>Standalone</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
Standalone sets up shared memory regions and forks off one instance of the program per place. The places all run on the local machine. There is one run configuration variable "X10_NPLACES", which should be set to the number of places. If not set, it defaults to 1 and prints a warning. The standalone has transport has a limit on the size of the data blocks that can be sent (about 512k), because of the shared memory regions. To run, just compile with "-x10rt standalone", set the run configuration variable, and run your executable. This transport is a good choice if you're running everything one one machine and don't use large messages. 
<p>
Debugging under standalone is relatively easy, since all places are forked off from the main process, and gdb can be configured to follow these forks. 

<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.
