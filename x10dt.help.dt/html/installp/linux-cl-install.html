<h1>Linux X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Linux, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++</li>
	<li>java</li>
	<li>open MPI</li>
</ul>

<h4>gcc/g++</h4>
gcc is included with the os. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>
In my case, running Fedora 9, gcc version 4.3.0 is installed

<h4>java</h4>
Although Java is often times included with Linux, it usually is the OpenJDK runtime
environment. Do the following to verify the location and version
<pre>
	whereis java
	java -version
</pre>
In the case of Fedora 9, java version 1.6.0 is installed.
However, it is recommended that you download and install the latest Sun JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
<pre>
	cd /usr
	mkdir java
	cd java
	cp ~/Download/jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin .
	chmod 777 jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	./jdk-1_5_0_11-linux-i586.bin
	...license...
	yes
</pre>
Then you should modify your .bash_profile file to contain this directory in the PATH statement.
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>
Then modify your .bashrc file to define JAVA_HOME
<pre>
.bashrc
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_11
export JAVA_HOME
</pre>

<h4>openmpi</h4>
OpenMPI is often not included with Linux. To check do the following
<pre>
	whereis mpirun
	mpirun -version
</pre>
In the case of Fedora 9, you should download version 1.3.x or later from the openmpi web site -
http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/
<p>
You should retrieve the openmpi-1.3.3.tar file or later version and unpack it.
<pre>
	tar -xvf openmpi-1.3.3.tar
</pre>
This will create an openmpi-1.3.3 directory.  Now you need to compile and
install openmpi using the following command sequence.
<pre>
	cd openmpi-1.3.3
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	
  ...lots of output...
	
	make all
	make install
</pre>
Note that the configure script supports a lot of different command line options. 
For example, the --prefix option in the above example tells Open MPI to install under the directory /usr/local/.
