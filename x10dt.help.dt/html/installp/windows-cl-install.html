<h1>Windows X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Windows, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.2.x or higher (for the X10 C++ backend)</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher (for the X10 Java backend)</li>
</ul>

<a name="gcc-prereq">
<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is not installed with Windows. To get gcc you will need to install the Cygwin package.
The latest version is 1.7.7. There are two ways to do this
<ol>
<li>script installation using the cygwin-install package documented 
under <a href="#batch-cygwin">the batch installation</a> 
<li>interactively using the cygwin installer which is documented 
under <a href="#interactive-cygwin">the interactive installation</a> 
</ol>

<a name="batch-cygwin">
<h4>1. Cygwin batch installation</h5>
We have developed a batch installation of Cygwin that you can downloaded
to install the Cygwin environment.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip">
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip</a>
<p>
You should download this file to a temporary directory, unzip the contents, and
run "cygsetup.bat".   This will prompt you for your windows id so it can create
the login directory and install some cygwin shell files. Also watch out for any
firewall prompts that you may have to respond to.
<p>
Once the installation is complete you should double check that the Windows PATH
environment variable has been updated to include the following directories:
<ul>
<li>C:\cygwin\bin</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the installation is complete you will be in the cygwin directory, and you
can start cygwin by running "cygwin.bat".  
<p>
We have also supplied another batch file called "addpkg.bat" which can be used
to download additional packages.  For example, you might want to download and 
install the unix editors, vim and emacs.  You would do this by running
<pre>
addpkg vim emacs
</pre>
<p>
For those who are interested in compiling the X10 distribution,
we have also supplied another batch file called "addbuildpkgs.bat" which will
download all the packages you need to build the x10 distribution.
<p>
You can now proceed to checking the <a href="#java-prereq">java prereq.</a>

<h4>2. Cygwin interactive installation</h5>
To get the base cygwin do the following
<ul>
<li>Go to the cygwin site
  http://www.cygwin.com/
<li>Click on install or update
  The latest Cygwin release is 1.7.1-1
<li>Save the setup file to a local folder, e.g. cygwinInstall
<li>Execute setup.exe
  Allow any firewall rules, if needed
<li>Click next
<li>Select a download source, usually Install from the Internet
<li>Select root install directory, usually C:\cygwin, along with install for All Users, click next
<li>Select local package directory, usually c:\cygwin, click next
<li>Select your internet connection, usually Direct connection, click next
<li>Select a download site, usually one closest to you, click next
<li>Click ok on any setup alerts
<li>select the packages, usually the defaults to begin with, click next
<li>select icons, click Finish
</ul>

<p>
Once the default packages have completed installing, you can start cygwin by
doing the following.
<pre>
cd c:\cygwin
cygwin.bat
</pre>
You should see the skeleton files being created for your userid.  The userid is
created from your windows id.

<p>
Once cygwin is working, you should relaunch setup and select the gcc/g++ compiler that
is required by X10. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Devel - 4.3.4-3 - gcc4-g++ G++ subpackage
</pre>

<p>
Select any other packages that you may want. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Utils - util-linux 2.14.1
</pre>

<a name="java-prereq">
<h3>java</h3>
Java is not included by default with Windows. However, nost people will have installed one already.
If not, you should download and install the latest Sun Java runtime or JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
You should install Java in the normal fashion either in "Program Files" or directly at the
root level. Usually you would make this installation your system JVM.
<p>
Cygwin should recognize that you have java installed and use it. The only thing that you should
do is make sure that JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables for X10 to use.
You can do this using the Windows control panel System application.
<pre>
Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
</pre>
Under System variables, check for JAVA_HOME and if not defined, click edit and enter the 
"Variable name" JAVA_HOME and the "Variable value" as the JRE or JDK path. Click Ok to save
your values.
<p>
You should start cygwin and test for Java by doing the following
<pre>
which java
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
</pre>
You should see something like this
<pre>
$ which java
/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/System32/java

$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_11"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode)

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
C:\jdk1.5.0_15
</pre>

<h4>Running x10 programs using <tt>Sockets</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
The sockets transport replaces <tt>pgas_sockets</tt> (which is closed-source, and requires some setup), and is currently the default backend if you don't compile with the "-x10rt" flag. You set an environment variable <tt>X10_NPLACES</tt> to specify the number of places. If this is not set, it defaults to 1 place on the local machine, and prints a warning. 
There are two ways to specify the machines to run on: 
<ul>
<li>Set the run configuration variable <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> to the full path for a hostfile. The hostfile is a simple text file that contains a list of hostnames to run on, with one line per machine. 
<li>Set the run configuration variable <tt>X10_HOSTLIST</tt>, to a comma-separated list of hostnames, without spaces. This run configuration variable is checked only if <tt>X10_HOSTFILE</tt> was not set. 
</ul>
Both of the above will wrap if there are more places than hostnames specified. For example, setting <tt>X10_NPROCS=4</tt> and <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=host1,host2</tt> will cause places 0 and 2 to run on host1, and places 1 and 3 to run on host2. If neither of the above is set, and there is more than 1 place, then it defaults to running everything on localhost, and prints a warning. You can set <tt>X10_HOSTLIST=localhost</tt> to get the same effect without warning. 
If you're running on more than one machine, you should have public/private key ssh authentication set up, so you can ssh from one machine to another without getting a password prompt. You should also have your executable and hostfile available in the same location on every machine listed in the hostfile. You compile your program with "-x10rt sockets", and with ssh in place, and the run configuration variables set, you run your executable. You don't have to launch from one of the machines in the hostfile, but you do need to have the ssh authentication set up between the machine you launch from and the first machine in the list. 
<p>
The sockets backend supports gdb debugging through the <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG</tt> run configuration variable. The value of this has two forms: 
<ul>
<li>"place:port", where place is the place that you want to be debugged or the string "all", and port is the port number that you want gdbserver to use. This launches the runtime for the specified place under gdbserver, which allows you to connect to the remote runtime with your local gdb session. See <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_134.html">this link</a> for more details. If you specify "all" for the place, then all places will be started under gdbserver at the specified port. Be aware that if you have multiple places running on the same machine, then this will cause port number conflicts. 
<li>"place", where place is either the place that you want to be debugged, or the string "all". Setting this to a number causes the specified place to be launched under gdb in a new xterm. For example, setting <tt>X10LAUNCHER_DEBUG=0</tt> will cause the x10 runtime for place 0 to be started in a gdb session in a new xterm, while other places run normally. Setting this to "all" will cause all runtimes to execute in separate gdb xterms. Each xterm is given a title showing which place it is running so you can keep track. 
</ul>
If you are running on triloka, please be sure to ssh to each machine in your hostlist to ensure that GSA is mounted and you don't get a password prompt. More than once I've forgotten to do this, and the program appears to hang, when under the covers it's waiting at a password prompt. 
<p>
It's possible to run without the launcher, and start up each place manually. To do this, you need to set the X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME, X10_PLACE, and X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS run configuration variables, which would normally be set by the launcher. For example: 
<ul>

<li>// Launch three places on triloka1-3, all using port 7001: 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=0 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka1 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=1 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka2 
<li>X10LAUNCHER_RUNTIME=true X10_PLACE=2 X10_NPLACES=3 X10LAUNCHER_FORCEPORTS=7001,7001,7001 X10_HOSTLIST=triloka1,triloka2,triloka3 // run on triloka3 
</ul>
Please note that currently, the Sockets backend will not work in an environment with mixed POWER and x86 hardware, due to different endianness. 
<p>

<h4>Running with <tt>Standalone</tt> backend</h4>
<p>
Standalone sets up shared memory regions and forks off one instance of the program per place. The places all run on the local machine. There is one run configuration variable "X10_NPLACES", which should be set to the number of places. If not set, it defaults to 1 and prints a warning. The standalone has transport has a limit on the size of the data blocks that can be sent (about 512k), because of the shared memory regions. To run, just compile with "-x10rt standalone", set the run configuration variable, and run your executable. This transport is a good choice if you're running everything one one machine and don't use large messages. 
<p>
Debugging under standalone is relatively easy, since all places are forked off from the main process, and gdb can be configured to follow these forks. 

<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.
