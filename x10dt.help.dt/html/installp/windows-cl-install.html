<h1>Windows Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Windows, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++</li>
	<li>java</li>
	<li>open MPI / mpich2</li>
</ul>

<h4>gcc/g++</h4>
gcc is not installed with Windows. To get gcc you will need to install cygwin.
To get the base cygwin do the following
<ul>
<li>Go to the cygwin site
  http://www.cygwin.com/
<li>Click on install or update
  The latest Cygwin release is 1.7.1-1
<li>Save the setup file to a local folder, e.g. cygwinInstall
<li>Execute setup.exe
  Allow any firewall rules, if needed
<li>Click next
<li>select download source, click next
<li>select root install directory, usually C:\cygwin, click next
<li>select local package directory, usually c:\cygwin, click next
<li>select your internet connection, usually Direct connection, click next
<li>select a download site, usually one closest to you, click next
<li>click ok on any setup alerts
<li>select the packages, usually the defaults to begin with, click next
<li>select icons, click Finish
</ul>

<p>
Once the default packages have completed installing, you can start cygwin by
doing the following.
<pre>
cd c:\cygwin
cygwin.bat
</pre>
You should see the skeleton files being created for your userid.  The userid is
created from your windows id.

<p>
Once cygwin is working, you should relaunch setup and select the gcc/g++ compiler that
is required by X10. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Devel - 4.3.4-3 - gcc4-g++ G++ subpackage
</pre>

<p>
Select any other packages that you may want. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Utils - util-linux 2.14.1
</pre>


<h4>java</h4>
Java is not included by default with Windows. However, nost people will have installed one already.
If not, you should download and install the latest Sun Java runtime or JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
You should install Java in the normal fashion either in "Program Files" or directly at the
root level. Usually you would make this installation your system JVM.
<p>
Cygwin should recognize that you have java installed and use it. The only thing that you should
do is make sure that JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables for X10 to use.
You can do this using the Windows control panel System application.
<pre>
Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
</pre>
Under System variables, check for JAVA_HOME and if not defined, click edit and enter the 
"Variable name" JAVA_HOME and the "Varible value" as the JRE or JDK path. Click Ok to save
your values.
<p>
You should start cygwin and test for Java by doing the following
<pre>
which java
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
</pre>
You should see something like this
<pre>
$ which java
/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/System32/java

$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_11"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode)

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
C:\jdk1.5.0_15
</pre>


<h4>openmpi / mpich2</h4>
OpenMPI is not include with Windows.
We have created a version of MPICH2 for Windows on the codehaus site that should be downloaded
and installed in the cygwin directory. Start the cygwin setup again and add this as a Cygwin mirror.
You'll have to run Cygwin setup with -X (command line, or through a shortcut) 
to make it avoid checking signatures.
<pre>
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin/
</pre>
If you do not ignore signatures, you will get this error:
<pre>
Unable to get http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin/setup.ini.sig from 
<http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin>
</pre>
The following package should be selected
<pre>
Base - 1.2.1-2 - mpich2: A high performance...
</pre>
Click next to install.
</p>
After it is installed you will find mpirun and other commands in
/usr/contrib/mpich2-1.1.1p1/bin
<p>
If you see the following error using mpirun
<pre>
cd /usr/contrib/mpich2-1.1.1p1/bin
./mpirun
/usr/bin/env: python2.5: No such file or directory
</pre>
you need to restart the cygwin setup, select your mirror, and make sure the following package is installed.
<pre>
Python - 2.5.5-1 - python: Python language interpreter
</pre>

<p>
Then you should modify your .bash_profile file to contain this directory in the PATH
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/contrib/mpich2-1.2.1/bin:${PATH}
export PATH
</pre>

<h2>Running X10 programs</h2>
<p>
Note that the C++ backend makes use of the MPICH2 runtime that is installed on your
system, so you can also enter the following command to run an x10 program
<p>
<pre>
mpirun -np 1 ./Hello.exe
</pre>
<p>
However, on Windows, a daemon (mpd) has to be running to use mpirun. This daemon requires a
.mpd.conf file in your home directory. You can create this by doing the following
<pre>
cd $HOME
touch .mpd.conf
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

...and then use an editor to insert a line like

  MPD_SECRETWORD=mr45-j9z
  
Of course use some other secret word than mr45-j9z.

</pre>
<p>
Now you can start the mpd daemon in the background so you can use mpirun to execute programs. 
<p>
<pre>
mpd&
</pre>
<p>
<p>
You will need to prefix your program
with a "./" so that mpirun knows to look in the current directory for the program. You
can fix this by adding "./" to your PATH directive in your profile.
<p>
Now you should be able to use mpirun to schedule programs.

<p>
If you see this error, it means that you have not started the daemon
<pre>
mpiexec_IBM_575BEBB7377: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_infos5);
  posssible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)
In case 1, you can start an mpd on this host with:
     mpd&
and you will be able to run jobs just on this host.
For more details on starting mpds on a set of hosts, se
the MPICH2 installation guide.
</pre>

<p>
If you get this error when starting the mpd daemon, you have not created the .mpd.conf
file in your home directory.
<pre>
A file named .mpd.conf file must be present in the user's home
directory (/etc/mpd.conf if root) with read and write access
only for the user, and must contain a least one line with:
MPD_SECRETWORD=<secretword>
One way to safely create this file is to do the following:
  cd $HOME
  touch .mpd.conf
  chmod 600 .mpd.conf
and then use an editor to insert a line like
  MPD_SECRETWORD=mr45-j9z
into the file. (Of course use some other secret word than mr45-j9z.)
