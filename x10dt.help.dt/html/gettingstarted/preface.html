<h1>Getting X10 and X10DT on your machine</h1>
<p>
We've put together some installation guides for various platforms that show in
detail how to set up your workstation to develop X10 programs. The
platforms supported are 
<p>
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/mac-cl-install.html">
Mac: http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/mac-cl-install.html</a> <br>
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/linux-cl-install.html">
Linux: http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/linux-cl-install.html</a> <br>
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/windows-cl-install.html">
Windows: http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/windows-cl-install.html</a> <br>
         
<p>
Once you have the environment set up, you will be able to run the programs in
this guide. If you are using the X10DT (described below), you can stop at the
installation of the X10 Distribution section, since this is not required for the
X10DT.
<p>
For Windows users, we have also developed a batch installation of the Cygwin
environment that X10 requires.  This will make it easier to get started than
getting what you need piecemeal off the Web. The installer can be downloaded
from
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip">
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip</a>.

You can refer to the Windows installation guide above for more details about its
use.
<p>
If you are an Eclipse user, the X10 Development Toolkit (X10DT) is a
plugin that can be installed
into Eclipse 3.5.x (Galileo) or Eclipse 3.6.x (Helios).  If you are unfamiliar
with Eclipse, it is a free Open Source IDE, and we recommend you take a look at
its introductory Web page, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php">
http://www.eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php</a>.
<p>  
If you have Eclipse installed, you can go to the 
<tt> Help</tt> menu and select '<tt>Install New Software</tt>'.  You will be asked
to add an update site.  The url to use for X10DT is:

<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.1/updateSite/">
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.1/updateSite/</a>.
<p>
If you want to install both Eclipse and X10DT together from scratch, there is
an all-in-one installation that contains everything you need to start
building X10 programs.  It can be downloaded from the X10 web site:

<a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10DT+2.1+Installation">
http://x10.codehaus.org/X10DT+2.1+Installation</a>.

<p>
The X10 web site, <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/">
http://x10.codehaus.org/</a>, is a source for the latest news about
X10. 
The X10 mailing lists are all hosted at <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/For+Users">
http://x10.codehaus.org/For+Users</a>. 
You can subscribe to any of them, but the ones most likely 
to be of interest are
<ul>
<li>x10-announce: for (infrequent) announcements of X10 releases, and
<li>x10-users: for a general X10 user list.
</ul>
