<h2 id="basic">Basic parts of X10DT</h2>


In the X10 Perspective, you will see the X10 projects in the Package Explorer, the editor, the Outline view,
a Console to show output, etc., and other views.
When you set up how you run your program, you will see the Launch Dialog where you specify how you want
to run the program (see below).
FIXME link to that section.

<h2 id="newproj">Creating an X10 project</h2>
<p>Be sure you are in the X10 Perspective.

Window > Open Perspective > Other ...   and select X10.



<p>To create a sample X10 project, Select File > New...  X10 Project.
<p>
<br><img src="images/newproj.png">
<br>Give your project a name, e.g. "Hello," accept the defaults, which includes generating a sample X10 "Hello World" application.
Hit Finish.
<p>The X10DT creates your new project, including the source file and edits the main source file.
It also builds (compiles) it before showing you the new file, so it may take a few seconds to show you the 
new source file.
<br>
FIXME hello world sample source has changed, need to redo images here.
<br><img src="images/newProjDone.png">
<h2 id="edit">Editing the X10 source code</h2>
<p>Syntax highlighting highlights X10 code depending on the different language features.
<br><img src="images/editor.png">
<p>
The Outline view shows the parts of the file. Expand the "Hello" class name in the Outline view
to show the sub-parts.  Select anything in this view to have the editor navigate to its location
and highlight what you have selected.
<br><img src="images/outlineView.png">

<p>Hover over an X10 method or class name to show a yellow popup of information about that item.
If there is javadoc ("X10doc") comment information, that will be shown.

<p>Content Assist (describe only if it works suitably in this version)

<p>There are many features of the Eclipse editor that we won't describe here.
But here is just one: for example, to turn on line numbering, right-click on the grey <i>marker bar</i> 
at the left editor the editor and select "Show Line Numbers."
<br><img src="images/lineNum1.png">
<p>You'll see the line numbers at the left edge of the editor.
<br><img src="images/lineNum2.png">

<h2 id="error">Errors in your code</h2>
<p>If there are errors in your code, you will see red error markers at the left edge of the offending line.
For example, remove the semicolon from the end of the last line in main().
<br><img src="images/errorMarker.png">
<p>Even before you save the file to re-compile it, you will see the error appear.
You can tell in this figure that the editor buffer has not been saved because the
filename, on the editor tab, is preceded by an asterisk(*).
<p>
Hover over the error marker with your cursor to see the reason for the error.
<br><img src="images/errorMarkerHover.png">
<p>If you save the file to cause a compile, or otherwise build your application,
any compile errors will also show up in the Problems view.
<br><img src="images/errorMarkerProblems.png">
<p>You can double-click on any item in the Problems view and the editor will
highlight that line in the source file.

<h2 id = "building">Building</h2>
<p>Each time you save the file, the X10 compiler builds it.  To turn off this behavior, you
can select Project > Build Automatically to uncheck this item.
Then, to force a rebuild, select Project > Clean ... To rebuild the current project.
<p>But building on each save is typical behavior - try it, you may find you like it.
<p>If you want to see a console of what happens when it builds, see
<a href="prefs.html">X10Preferences</a> and the option to "Echo compile arguments to console".



<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
To run your X10 program, the simplest way is to hit the green "Run" button (while the project or source file is selected).
It's the green circle in the toolbar with the white triangle inside it.
If you hover over this button, you'll see the words "Run Hello.x10" assuming that's the name of your program.
<p>FIXME: get screen shot that includes the cursor
<br><img src="images/run.png">
<p>Hit the Run button to execute your program with all default settings for launching.
<br>The Console view shows the output (if any).
<br><img border="1" src="images/runDone.png">
<p>If you want to specify more options for running your program, you'll need to edit the Eclipse
<i>launch configuration</i>.
<p>Next to the run button, there is a downward-pointing arrow.  Select that and select 
"Run Configurations..."   Alternatively, you can select the Run menu, and under that, select
"Run Configurations..."
<p>(Note: we describe the behavior of Eclipse 3.4.  Eclipse 3.3 and other versions of Eclipse may
label the menu items slightly differently.)

<br><img border="1" src="images/runConfig.png">
<p>
If your project was selected, this dialog is shown with your 
existing launch configuration shown, assuming you executed the example above to run your program at least once.
If you haven't, then select "X10 Application" in the list on the left, and select the "New" button to create one.
(If you select "X10 Application" you'll see a list of what the buttons are on the right.)
On the main tab, if your Project isn't already selected ("Hello" in our case), use the Browse button
to select it, or enter it in the text field.  Do the same for the Main class.  If you use the Search button,
you will be presented with several items - choose the "Main - Hello" class.




The "Main" tab is shown first.  
<br><img border="1" src="images/runConfigMain.png">
<p>Select the "Arguments" tab to specify arguments to your program (if any).


<br><img border="1" src="images/runConfigArgs.png">
Program arguments will be passed to the Main method, and VM arguments are used in the launching virtual machine.
For example, to launch with assertions turned on, add "-ea" to the VM arguments. 
<br>
FIXME show example of using args since 'hello world' has changed and can make use of args now

<p>To start your X10 application, Select the "Run" button in the lower right corner of the launch
configuration dialog.

The program runs, and the output appears in the console view.
