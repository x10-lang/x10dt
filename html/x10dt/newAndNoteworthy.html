<h1>X10DT - New and Noteworthy</h1>
  <h3>X10DT 2.0.5 Features</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>New compiler option "Conservative Build", which is turned
on by default. When turned on, this option causes each file that has no
generated code in a project to be re-submitted for compilation on every
build. This ensures that all the files that need to be recompiled are
indeed compiled when the user saves in an editor, and overcomes some
shortcomings of the compiler which make it difficult to compute
dependencies between files. 
<br/>See <a href="prefs.html#compiler">X10 Preferences</a> for more information.

  <h3>X10DT 2.0.2 Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Content assist: <a href="ContentAssist.html">code templates and completion</a>  </li>
    <li>Adapted the linking step with projects using C++ back-end on MacOS and Linux platforms with 
    new X10 shared libraries, 
    resulting in faster creation of end-user executables, as well as smaller size.</li>
