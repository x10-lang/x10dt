The statement <b>finish S</b> converts global termination to local
termination and introduces a root activity. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  :  |        <em>  
<table>
<tr><td align="right">Statement ::= FinishStatement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">FinishStatement ::= <b>finish</b> Statement 
</td></tr></table>
</em>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity A executes <b>finish S</b> by executing <b>S</b>.  The
execution of <b>S</b> may spawn other asynchronous activities (here or
at other places).  Uncaught exceptions thrown or propagated by any
activity spawned by <b>S</b> are accumulated at <b>finish S</b>.
<b>finish S</b> terminates locally when all activities spawned by
<b>S</b> terminate globally (either abruptly or normally). If <b>S</b>
terminates normally, then <b>finish S</b> terminates normally and A
continues execution with the next statement after <b>finish S</b>.  If
<b>S</b> terminates abruptly, then <b>finish S</b> terminates abruptly
and throws a single exception, <b>x10.lang.MultipleExceptions</b>
formed from the collection of exceptions accumulated at <b>finish S</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thus a <b>finish S</b> statement serves as a collection point for
uncaught exceptions generated during the execution of <b>S</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that repeatedly <b>finish</b>ing a statement has no effect after
the first <b>finish</b>: <b>finish finish S</b> is indistinguishable
from <b>finish S</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Interaction with clocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a name="sec:finish:clock-rule">
</a>
<b>finish S</b> interacts with clocks (&#167;). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While executing <b>S</b>, an activity must not spawn any <b>clocked</b>
asyncs. (Asyncs spawned during the execution of <b>S</b> may spawn
clocked asyncs.) A
<b>ClockUseException</b> is thrown
if (and when) this condition is violated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In X10 v2.0 this condition is checked dynamically; future
versions of the language will introduce type qualifiers which permit
this condition to be checked statically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>
<b>Future Extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
The semantics of <b>finish S</b> is conjunctive; it terminates when all
the activities created during the execution of <b>S</b> (recursively)
terminate. In many situations (e.g., nondeterministic search) it is
natural to require a statement to terminate when any <em>one</em> of the
activities it has spawned succeeds. The other activities may then be
safely aborted. Future versions of the language may introduce a
<b>finishone S</b> construct to support such speculative or nondeterministic
computation.
