<div class="p"><!----></div>
An X10 computation may have many concurrent <em>activities</em> "in
flight" at any give time. We use the term activity to denote a
dynamic execution instance of a piece of code (with references to
data). An activity is intended to execute in parallel with other
activities. An activity may be thought of as a very light-weight
thread.  In X10 v2.0, an activity may not be interrupted,
suspended or resumed as the result of actions taken by any other
activity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity is spawned in a given place and stays in that place for
its lifetime.  An activity may be <em>running</em>, <em>blocked</em> on some
condition or <em>terminated</em>. When the statement associated with an
activity terminates normally, the activity terminates normally; when
it terminates abruptly with some reason R, the activity terminates
with the same reason (&#167;).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may be long-running and may invoke recursive methods (thus
may have a stack associated with it). On the other hand, an activity
may be short-running, involving a fine-grained operation such as a
single read or write.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may asynchronously and in parallel launch activities at
other places.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 distinguishes between <em>local</em> termination and <em>global</em>
termination of a statement. The execution of a statement by an
activity is said to terminate locally when the activity has finished
all its computation related to that statement. (For instance the
creation of an asynchronous activity terminates locally when the
activity has been created.)  It is said to terminate globally when it
has terminated locally and all activities that it may have spawned at
any place (if any) have, recursively, terminated globally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An X10 computation is initiated as a single activity from the
command line. This activity is the <em>root activity</em> for the entire computation. The entire computation
terminates when (and only when) this activity globally
terminates. Thus X10 does not permit the creation of so called
"daemon threads"-threads that outlive the lifetime of the root
activity. We say that an X10 computation is <em>rooted</em>
(&#167;).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>
<b>Future Extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> We may permit the initial activity to be a daemon activity
to permit reactive computations, such as webservers, that may not
terminate.</em>
