An  X10 place is a repository for data and activities. Each place
is to be thought of as a locality boundary: the activities running in
a place may access data items located at that place with the
efficiency of on-chip access. Accesses to remote places may take
orders of magnitude longer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 X10 provides a built-in value class, "x10.lang.place"; all
places are instances of this class.  This class is "final" in
 X10 v1.7.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In  X10 v1.7, the set of places available to a computation is
determined at the time that the program is run and remains fixed
through the run of the program. The number of places available 
may be determined by reading ("Place.MAX_PLACES"). (This number
is specified from the command line/configuration information; 
see associated <tt>README</tt> documentation.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All scalar objects created during program execution are located in one
place, though they may be referenced from other places. Aggregate
objects (arrays) may be distributed across multiple places using
distributions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The set of all places in a running instance of an  X10 program may
be obtained through the "const" field "Place.places".  (This
set may be used to define distributions, for instance,
.) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The set of all places is totally ordered.  The first place may be
obtained by reading "Place.FIRST_PLACE". The initial activity for
an  X10 computation starts in this place
(). For any place, the operation "next()"
returns the next place in the total order (wrapping around at the
end). Further details on the methods and fields available on this
class may be obtained by consulting the API documentation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Future versions of the language may permit user-definable
places, and the ability to dynamically create places.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
Variables of type "Place" must be initialized and are implicitly
"final".
