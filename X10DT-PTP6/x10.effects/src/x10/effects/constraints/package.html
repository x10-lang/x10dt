An effect systems reasons about <em> disjointness </em> of <em>
locations</em>. A <code>Locs</code> encodes a single source language 
expression that represents sets of mutable runtime locations. 

<p>
We have the following kinds of <code>Locs</code>.

<ol>
<li> <code>ObjLocs</code>. An <code>ObjLocs</code> is created with an 
<code>XTerm t</code> whose type is an object type
which has some mutable field. (Hence, not an array, not a primitive type.) It
represents the set of locations corresponding to the mutable fields
of the object designated by t.
<li> <code>ArrayLocs</code>. An <code>ArrayLocs</code> is created with an 
<code>Xterm t</code> whose type is a mutable
array type. (Hence, not an object, not a primitive type.) It represents
the set of locations corresponding to the elements of the array.
<li> <code>LocalLocs</code>. A <code>LocalLocs</code> is created with an 
<code> XLocal t</code> -- it represents the location associated with the local
variable designated by <code>t</code>.
<li> <code>FieldLocs</code>. A <code>FieldLocs</code>  is created with
an <code> ObjLocs t</code> and an <code>XName g</code> corresponding to 
an object with mutable fields and one of its mutable fields respectively. 
It represents the singleton location corresponding to <code>t.f</code>
<li><code>ArrayElementLocs</code>. A <code>ArrayElementLocs</code> is 
created with an <code>ArrayLocs a</code> and an <code>Index t</code>
corresponding to a mutable array and an index respectively. It 
represents the singleton location corresponding to <code>a(t)</code>.
